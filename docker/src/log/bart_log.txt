[ 20240518-11:43:28 ] [model] summary result: A commonly held, optimistic view is that knowledge has improved monotonically over time, and will continue to do so. This appears to be the case for certain scientific fields like physics, chemistry, or molecular biology. In other domains, however, it is less clear, especially within regions. The distribution of knowledge across individuals also varies over time.
