[ 20240518-12:00:13 ] [model] summary result: The QALY-PQALY evaluation function, represented by Theorem 6, evaluates distributions by a convex combination of the QALYs and PQALYs, considering both health effects and productivity effects as important outcomes of interventions. Dismissing the TIUP axiom results in the QALY-PQALY evaluation function, which assigns equal weight to pure health effects and productivity-adjusted life years, and does not increase the desirability of an intervention if improvements in lifetime among unproductive individuals do not increase the desirability. This evaluation function also subscribes to the same two invariance axioms as the QALY-PALY function. The QALY-PALY function, represented by Theorem 8, allows for a weaker time invariance axiom at common health and productivity, while the HPYE evaluation function, represented by Theorem 9, evaluates distributions by the unweighted aggregation of healthy productive years equivalent (HPYE) the intervention yields, and does not matter which particular individual receives these extra life years. The generalized HPYE evaluation function, represented by Theorem 10, is precisely characterized by the set of COMMON axioms, and does not necessarily follow a simple unweighted aggregation of HPYEs, as formalized by the evaluation function.

[ 20240518-12:20:26 ] [model] summary result: In high home fidelity social dilemmas, the successful fixation of a strategy is determined by its relative success in introducing itself in other communities and successfully fixating there. Social dilemmas can be divided into three categories: non-threshold, threshold, and threshold-like. Non-threshold dilemmas allow cooperation to evolve for any community size if the reward-to-cost ratio V/K surpasses a critical value, which is independent of the community size. Threshold dilemmas have a critical value of the reward-to-cost ratio, above which cooperation evolves, only if the size of communities is at least of the same size as the public goods production threshold (Q ≥ L). Threshold-like dilemmas have a critical value of the reward-to-cost ratio, above which cooperation evolves, only if the size of communities is at least of the same size as the public goods production threshold (Q ≥ L). Under threshold dilemmas, cooperation can never evolve if the size of communities is smaller than the public goods production threshold (Q ≤ L). The HD dilemma, which is a commons dilemma, has a reward-to-cost ratio lower than the critical value for cooperation to evolve. The critical value of the reward-to-cost ratio increases with the size of communities and the used evolutionary dynamics. Increasing the size of communities leads to stricter conditions for the evolution of cooperation. The impact of between-community reproduction and within-community fixation decreases with community size under the BDB/BDD dynamics, while under the DBB/BDD dynamics, both effects interplay and each dominates at a different scale of community sizes. The rules obtained under the CPD are parallel not only to the clique structures explored in At the same time, when interacting via the CPD, cooperators can never evolve if the evolutionary dynamics considered are the BDB/DBD/LB/LD dynamics, as shown in appendix A.2 for arbitrary values of intensity of selection and number of communities.

[ 20240518-12:24:36 ] [model] summary result: In the limit of high home fidelity, the probability of within-community fixation in multiplayer social dilemmas depends on the advantage held by the strategies in two contexts: when in homogeneous communities and when in within-community fixation processes. Consistently, the probability of within-community fixation for cooperators is higher than that for defectors, and the within-community fixation probability for a single cooperator in a community of defectors is given by the ratio between the fitness of cooperators and the total population size divided by the reward-to-cost ratio. The probability of the size of a community increasing by one in the next evolutionary step depends on the transition probabilities under the territorial raider model, which are independent of the community topology and depend only on the within-community fixation probabilities and the probability ratio Γ. The difference in transition probabilities affects the probability that the number of communities increases or decreases by one in the next evolutionary step, with the DBB dynamics exhibiting a higher probability of within-community fixation and the BDD dynamics exhibiting a higher probability of between-community replacements. The transition probabilities under the DBB and BDD dynamics are independent of the particular set of edges between the nodes of the network, but only the time-scale at which these transitions occur. The limit of weak selection and the limit of large population size do not impact the resulting asymptotic fixation probability expansions and the conditions for the evolution of a given strategy to be favored in comparison to neutral fixation. The limit of weak selection introduces corrections to the effective fitness, and the limit of large population size affects the transition probabilities and the derivatives of the effective fitness. The critical value of the reward-to-cost ratio for cooperation to fixate in public goods dilemmas depends on the intensity of selection and the number of communities, with larger community sizes requiring higher reward-to-cost ratios for cooperators to successfully fixate.

The top-𝑘 scalar weights are then used to identify tokens that will participate in a block's computations, while downstream performance is affected by how aggressively the blocks' capacities are shrunk and the routing algorithm implemented. The authors hypothesize that learned routing is preferable, as the network can learn which tokens require more or less processing than others, and the network can preserve its performance by routing tokens to one of two computational paths: (1) self-attention and MLP blocks, and (2) a residual connection.

[ 20240518-12:40:31 ] [model] summary result: The MAB (Maximizing Average Reward) framework extends the exploration-exploitation tradeoff in sequential decision-making, specifically focusing on arms in the bandit literature. It models the stochastic reward process with uncertainty captured by θ ∈ Θ, where θ * t denotes the union of all, per-arm, parameters at time t. The MAB formulation covers stationary and non-contextual bandits, allowing for time-varying context and parameter updates via the Bayesian approach. The optimal action is determined by maximizing the expected reward expectation, considering the uncertainty induced by the true model parameters. Various MAB policies, such as Thompson sampling and Bayes-UCB, have been proposed to address the exploration-exploitation tradeoff, but these are limited to specific reward functions and time-evolving models. The SMC-based MAB framework extends these solutions to accommodate more flexible reward functions, non-stationary bandit environments, and a modular approach to Bayesian MAB algorithms.
