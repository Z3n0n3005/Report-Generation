[ 20240518-14:29:48 ] [model] summary result: The low mass of the main asteroid belt (MAB) is attributed to early depletion processes, which could have occurred through disk-planet tidal interactions, early MAB depletion during terrestrial planet formation, or a partially or fully depleted primordial MAB, with the formation and early evolution of the solar system heavily influenced by the initial amount of mass present in the MAB.

[ 20240518-14:30:27 ] [model] summary result: To model the evolution of the MAB SFD and the accretion of planetesimals with D > 500 km in the MAB region, we assumed a uniformly distributed initial distribution of planetesimals between 1.8 and 3.6 au, followed the accretion of objects within the MAB region for 5 Myr, using LIPAD (Lagrangian Integrator for Planetary Accretion and Dynamics) to simulate the dynamics and accretion of planetesimals with self-gravitational interactions and collisions, discarding objects below 1 mm in size to maintain the accretion process.

[ 20240518-14:30:51 ] [model] summary result: During the giant planet instability after gas disk dispersal, the MAB region's depletion factors vary among five sub-regions defined by varying orbital sizes, with the extent of depletion not being uniform across all sub-regions, as evidenced by the work by the authors and their analysis of depletion factors in the Minor Planet Center (MPC) database.

[ 20240518-14:31:27 ] [model] summary result: The study aims to evaluate the evolution, depletion, and the number of V-type objects (with D > 500 km) within the MAB, while accounting for the semi-major axis dependency of depletion, to provide insights into the primordial MAB mass and constraints on its objects, focusing on Vesta as an example, and considering the possibility of objects either not forming or surviving depletion.

[ 20240518-14:32:00 ] [model] summary result: The primary objective of the study was to determine the maximum possible total mass that could have existed in the primordial MAB region, revealing that the current MAB total mass is tiny and the primordial MAB mass likely ranged from approximately 0.5 to 2.14×10^-3 M⊕, with the maximum depletion occurring at around 0.5 Myr after CAIs, resulting in a smaller total mass compared to the current MAB S-complex population.
