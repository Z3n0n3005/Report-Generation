      "content": "the mechanism is implemented via individual accounts of non-tradable credits called karma.\nin human contexts, the most well-known example of a karma-like mechanism is the 'choice system' adopted by u.s. food banks, where the role of karma tokens is taken by 'shares.' as with karma, food banks under the choice system bid shares to obtain priority for available food donations, and the total payment of shares is redistributed at the end of each day.\nin this paper, we move to a controlled test of such a mechanism as the behavioral uptake by the human actors involved as well as the distributional consequences continue to remain unstudied experimentally.karma and the aforementioned choice system are different from other token-based mechanisms that have been implemented and proposed in the past, including those that use tradable credits, non-tradable vouchers, or so-called artificial currencies or scrips.\nfirst, karma is non-tradable even in a black market, as it is associated to individual accounts and can be transferred only in fixed resource allocation instances.\nblue now happens to have high urgency and bids 4, thus outbidding and getting priority over orange whose karma account is nine and bids 3.\nsimilar to how 'image scoring, ' which is an example of an explicit reputation mechanism, formalizes the notion of indirect reciprocity in reputation-based interactions], karma can be viewed as the formal equivalent of 'fair turn-taking' in repeated resource allocation tasks.\nwhile image scoring has been subjected to the behavioral test in the past, it remains to do so for karma.further, the example also illustrates another feature of karma, as was mentioned above, that distinguishes karma from fixed-value tokens and from other forms of rules ensuring turn-taking: it allows individuals to dynamically express how intense their private preference for the resource is.\nindeed,show that farsighted nash equilibria are almost fully efficient with respect to the private urgency of the users.to date, the literature on karma focused on the theoretical properties of the mechanism compared with random allocation and other domain-specific schemes such as dynamic pricing or max-min allocation, all predicted on idealized assumptions such as rationality, far-sightedness and perfect adoption."

      "content": "treatments varied in the dynamic urgency process of the participants and the richness of the karma scheme.\nfor richness, we tested a binary scheme where participants can choose from only two bid levels that depend on their karma, and a full range scheme where participants have full choice over the bid up to their karma.the game we study is one that proceeds with \ud835\udc41 participants over \ud835\udc47 -many rounds.\nall participants receive an initial endowment of karma \ud835\udc58 (0) = \ud835\udc58 (1) = \ud835\udc58 init \u2208 n and an initial game score \ud835\udc60 (0) = 0.\neach participant is given an urgency value \ud835\udc62 (\ud835\udc61) \u2208 {\ud835\udc62 l , \ud835\udc62 h } that is drawn randomly and independently from a process p(\ud835\udc62) that is identical for all players, and must place a bid \ud835\udc4f (\ud835\udc61) \u2264 \ud835\udc58 (\ud835\udc61).\nin each pairwise matching, the higher bidder gets allocated the resource: the score \ud835\udc60 (\ud835\udc61) = \ud835\udc60 (\ud835\udc61 -1) +\ud835\udc62 (\ud835\udc61) increases by the urgency and the bid is collected as payment.\nin case \ud835\udc5d tot is not divisible by \ud835\udc41 , \ud835\udc5d tot \ud835\udc41 is redistributed to everyone, and a random subset of \ud835\udc5d tot -\ud835\udc41 \ud835\udc5d tot \ud835\udc41 participants receive one additional karma.\nafter the redistribution the game proceeds to the next round \ud835\udc61 + 1.tablein appendix a summarizes the notation introduced above.we follow a 2x2 factorial treatment design, where we vary the dynamic urgency process of the participants and the richness of the karma scheme.\nfor each of the four resulting treatments we run 5 independent game experiments with 20 participants per experimental game resulting in 100 subjects per treatment and 400 subjects in total.table.\nin the treatment variation of binary, participants can only choose between two bid levels: 0 or \ud835\udc58 2 (i.e., half their karma, rounded down to the nearest integer).\nin the treatment variation of full range, participants can choose any integer bid up to their karma.\nin each round, participants get drawn a random urgency.\nthe results page communicates the outcome of the round in terms of whether priority is granted, the karma payment and redistribution, and the updated karma balance and game score.\nfiguresin appendix a show examples of these pages.at the end of the game, participants are awarded a monetary payoff consisting of a fixed fee \ud835\udf19 fix and a bonus fee \ud835\udf19 bon that depends on the final score \ud835\udc60 (\ud835\udc47 ).\nthe bonus fee is determined according to the following rule:\u2022 if the participant is inactive for more than 6 consecutive rounds, they are considered to not complete the experiment and are not awarded any payoff, i.e., \ud835\udf19 fix = \ud835\udf19 bon = 0; \u2022 otherwise, the bonus fee is computed as an affine function of the score, given bythis rule linearly interpolates between two payment levels: \ud835\udf19 targ is the payment associated with a target score \ud835\udc60 targ ; and \ud835\udf19 rand is the payment associated with the expected score for random bidding \ud835\udc60 rand ."

      "content": "on this basis, we will assess efficiency based on the median efficiency gain among participants, and fairness based on the distribution of efficiency gains.overall, we find that there are pronounced and statistically significant efficiency gains in all treatments, higher under the high stake process than under the low stake process, but not significantly different from one another in terms of overall efficiency gains depending on whether the bidding scheme is binary or full range.\nthere are positive total efficiency gains in all treatments (median ranging from 7.38% to 15.34%).the efficiency gains are especially pronounced in the upper half of the population (median ranging from 22.51% to 29.85%); whereas the lower half of the population does not perform much worse than ex-ante expected under random allocation (median ranging from -6.5% to -0.65%), and in fact performs better than the lower half of the population under random allocation ex-post.\ncomparing the efficiency gains between treatments, it is found that, while all treatments outperform random, there are weakly significantly higher gains of the high stake treatments relative to the low stake treatments (low stake: median 10.27%, \ud835\udc5b = 200; high stake: median 14.20%, \ud835\udc5b = 200; mww test \ud835\udc48 = 17 864, \ud835\udc5d = 0.0647).\nrefer to tablein appendix c for a detailed inter-treatment comparison.figureshows that in addition to achieving overall efficiency gains, the karma allocation is more efficient than random allocation for both the lower/less fortunate and the higher/more fortunate halves of the population.\nto account for the fact that there will be more or less fortunate individuals under random allocation, figurealso shows the ex-post mean efficiency gains per population decile for random allocation, with the 95% confidence interval estimated from 1000 independent simulations per treatment.\nthis suggests that all (active) subgroups of the population achieve strong benefits in this treatment.notice that the variability in the ex-post efficiency gains under random allocation, cf.\nsuch a scheme would achieve the same aggregate efficiency as random allocation, but ensure the ex-post efficiency gains are more equally distributed around zero in figure.\ntherefore, in comparison to a simple turn-taking scheme, karma would also achieve pronounced efficiency gains overall, meanwhile the proportion of the population benefiting would drop to 70% to 80% depending on the treatment."

      "header": "DISCUSSION",
      "content": "their behavior, even though more efficient than random, however, is not as efficient as is theoretically feasible under nash equilibrium play: indeed, significantly higher efficiency gains would result from nash equilibrium behavior, which we computed using tools fromand confirmed in numerical simulations of equilibrium play (experiments: median 12.50%, \ud835\udc5b = 400; nash: median 38.83%, \ud835\udc5b = 400 000, mww test \ud835\udc48 = 19 342 103, \ud835\udc5d = 0.0000).\na natural follow-up question is, therefore, whether karma could be capable of achieving higher efficiency gains than realized in our online experiments if the human population consisted of participants that were better trained.\ntherefore, we may interpret the efficiency gains that were realized in our online experiment as behaviorally robust lower bounds on the performance of the karma scheme given the relatively low training and commitment of the subject pool considered.another way to interpret the observed differences between online subjects and nash or expert play may be related to impatience or perception of future rounds as less important.\nit was found that the realized gains of online subjects correspond to if players discount future rounds by a factor of approximately 0.3-0.7, while those of experts correspond to a future discount factor of more than 0.98.another important consideration regarding implementation of karma with human participants is whether a simpler scheme (binary) or a richer scheme (full range) is favourable.\ntheoretically, nash equilibrium under binary bidding will lose in efficiency with more than two urgency levels, and it remains an open question to test what the trade-off is between behavioral simplicity of a binary (or otherwise limited) bidding scheme and the theoretical benefits that come with richer schemes.\na richer analysis of this complexity-performance trade-off provides fruitful avenues for future investigations, both in theory and in the behavioral lab.finally, to conclude, we would like to highlight that the most favorable treatment combination in our experiments was that of high stake urgency process under binary bidding scheme; both median efficiency gains and the distribution of gains were higher in that combination than in all others.\nunfortunately, due to the bug, hypothesis (5) could not be tested.tablereports the mww test results when comparing the efficiency gains of the first versus the second halves of the experiments, per treatment.\nwith the exception of low stake-binary versus high stake-binary (and consequently combined low stake versus high stake), no statistically significant differences are observed.figurecompares the median efficiency gains realized in our online mturk experiments with a) the gains that would have been achieved if the participants followed the nash equilibrium (as determined by running 1000 simulations), and b) for the low stake-full range treatment, the gains achieved by 'expert' subjects, those are, students of an applied game theory class.\nfor the low stake-binary treatment, the median efficiency gain from an 'expert' game theory class experiment is also shown."
