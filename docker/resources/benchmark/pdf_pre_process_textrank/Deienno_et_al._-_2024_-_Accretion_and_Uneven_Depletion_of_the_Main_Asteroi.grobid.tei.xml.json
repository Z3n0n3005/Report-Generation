      "content": "however, there is a consensus in the literature that water/volatile-poor (s-complex) and water/volatile-rich (c-complex) formed in the respectively regions interior and exterior to the orbit of jupiter (e.g.;several works in the literature (e.g.,, to cite a few) have attempted to find dynamical models that can reproduce both the low mass and taxonomic mixing observed in the current mab.\nin this case, the observed total mass of the mab would result from the implantation of asteroids of s-and c-complex taxonomic classes,b, see also), combined with the mass of s-complex primordial asteroids that formed in the mab region.\nin this scenario, the distinction between where s-and c-complex asteroids would form and their mixing into the mab region, however, are less clear as all asteroids (planetesimals) would potentially form out of the same pebble flux.it is clear from the discussion presented in the previous paragraphs that the primordial amount of mass that initially existed in the mab is a key ingredient to dictate the formation and early evolution of the solar system.\nthe few works that accounted for collisional evolution of the mab (e.g.;) mostly concentrated on understanding the evolution of the mab size-frequency distribution (sfd), but with limited dynamical effects (i.e. assuming mab collision probabilities and impact velocities were nearly constant through the age of the solar system) or with models that do not reflect present-day thinking on the problem (i.e., assuming that protoplanets formed in the asteroid belt;.\ntherefore, to advance in our understanding of not just where but how planetesimals formed and how planets evolved in the early history of the solar system, it is crucial that we understand how much mass existed in the mab region after planetesimals formed.to do that, it is important that we consider not only the mab total mass, but also its sfd.only three objects in the current mab have d > 500 km.\nwe show that, unless the primordial mass of the mab was indeed very low (\u2272 2.14\u00d710 -m \u2295 ) 3 before accretion started, the number of s-complex objects with d > 500 km that would form and survive solar system evolution largely exceed the number currently observed (i.e., n s-complex (d > 500 km) = 1; (4) vesta;.we present our work in the following structure: section 2 describes our modeling."

      "content": "there is a debate in the literature on whether such a small mab mass was primordial (e.g.;or whether the primordial mab total mass was much larger than currently observed (e.g.;.in this work we followed accretion (growth and fragmentation) of planetesimals in the mab during the period when gas still existed in the solar nebula.\nwe assumed different values of total mass for our primordial mab (see section 2 for a detailed description of model parameters), and that all of our primordial mab asteroids would be of inner solar system s-complex taxonomic type (demeo & carry 2014, see also discussion in section 1).\nfinally, we compared our findings with data from real asteroids in the mpc catalog.the first main result of the present work is that we found the mab depletion is uneven, i.e., different radial subregions of the mab are depleted at different rates (table).\nthe overall mab depletion factor reported in the last column of tableshould only be used as a guide for estimating overall mass depletion, but not size-dependent population depletion, as the latter is also semimajor-axis dependent.the second main result of the present work is that we found the maximum total mass that could have formed in the primordial mab at around 0.5 myr after cais is likely to be smaller than \u2248 2.14\u00d710 -3 m \u2295 .\nfurthermore, we find that objects with d > 200-300 km, including asteroid (4) vesta, are more likely to be terrestrial planetesimals implanted into the mab (or more specifically into the imb) during terrestrial planet growth) than asteroids that grew in-situ (see discussion in sections 4.2 and 4.3 for a detailed rational).finally, we conclude by noting that our results are independent of terrestrial planet formation models and/or early evolution of the giant planets (e.g.;.\nthis conclusion is supported by the fact that, for primordial mab masses larger than \u2248 2.14\u00d710 -3 m \u2295 , accretion into the mab starts very early (i.e., within the first few 100s of kyr after planetesimal formation; here considered to be 0.5 myr after cais).\ntherefore, unless depletion took place within the first few 100s of kyr after cais, mab primordial masses larger than \u2248 2.14\u00d710 -3 m \u2295 would lead to unobserved features in the current mab."
