<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Few aspects concern human beings more than health. But resources are scarce and, as we face demographic changes, with increased demand from retirees and a constrained labour market due to shrinking working age share of the population, there is a pressing need to protect the health and productivity of the economically active population. Therefore, critical decisions on health care interventions, as well as occupational health and safety policies, have to be made constantly. The evidence from clinical trials and observational studies, in addition to assessments about the productivity consequences, are crucial to make those decisions. The purpose of this paper is to develop a unified framework for the measurement and valuation of outcomes of such programmes and policies.</p><p>It is widely accepted that the health benefit a patient derives from a particular health care intervention can be defined according to two natural dimensions: quality of life and quantity of life. <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Pliskin et al. (1980)</ref> pioneered in multiattribute utility theory the axiomatic foundations of the so-called quality-adjusted life years (in short, QALYs), which offer a straightforward procedure to combine the two natural dimensions. Together with the so-called disability-adjusted life years (in short, DALYs), a primary focus of the landmark Global Burden of Disease studies, they are arguably the most frequently employed methodologies in the evaluation of health outcomes nowadays (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Gold et al., 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Murray et al., 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Drummond et al., 2015)</ref>.</p><p>An alternative to QALYs is the so-called productivity-adjusted life years (in short, PALYs), which are calculated by multiplying a productivity index by years lived. The productivity index ranges from 0 (completely unproductive) to 1 (completely productive), and may take into consideration factors such as absence from work due to ill health (absenteeism), reduced productivity while at work (presenteeism) and premature exit from the workforce (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Magliano et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Ademi et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Savira et al., 2021)</ref>.</p><p>Economic evaluation of policies to improve occupational health and safety is one field of research where productivity outcome measures following the broader PALY idea are applied extensively (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Tompa et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr">Steel et al., 2018a</ref><ref type="bibr">Steel et al., , 2018b))</ref>. Similar to standard health economic evaluation, this involves measuring costs and effects of working environment interventions except that many studies in this field concentrate on measuring changes in productivity as the most important intervention effect while leaving health effects out (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Noben et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Finnes et al., 2022)</ref>. Productivity effects of interventions are often operationalised and measured for each individual employee as sickness absence and reduced productivity while the employees are at work <ref type="bibr">(presenteeism)</ref>. Many studies are performed as a cost-benefit analysis from an employer's perspective where the purpose of the analysis is to assess if the costs of an intervention can be covered entirely or to a degree through the value of improved productivity <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Grimani et al., 2018)</ref>. However, from a societal perspective, it seems too narrow to focus exclusively on productivity effects, as working environment interventions will often have wider benefits including effects on employee health. Now, productivity effects are also often taken into account in the evaluation of health care itself (not just workplace safety). The traditional approach has been to net indirect earnings effects out of the cost of treatment (on the basis of the present value of the additional stream of lifetime income for an individual, possibly involving realistic situations such as involuntary unemployment) and keep the QALY outcome measure (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Rice and Cooper, 1967;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Koopmanschap et al., 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Sculpher, 2001)</ref>. Another more recent approach, which is growing rapidly to the extent of becoming a new development in health economic evaluation, is precisely to switch from QALYs or DALYs to PALYs as the outcome measure. A sizable number of healthcare applications are lately endorsing this approach (see, for instance, <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Ademi et al. (2021)</ref> and the references cited therein). Nevertheless, PALYs as an outcome measure lack a proper theoretical justification. An aim of this paper is to fill that gap in this emerging literature by providing axiomatic foundations of this newly proposed outcome measure. Furthermore, rather than replacing QALYs by PALYs, one could conceivably think about compromising between both, as they can each be seen as partial measures to evaluate outcomes of health care interventions or occupational health and safety policies. QALYs dismiss productivity, whereas PALYs dismiss quality-of-life (morbidity) concerns. More general evaluation functions encompassing both concerns would be more complete and thus more appropriate from a societal perspective. We also provide in this paper axiomatic foundations for evaluation functions allowing for compromises among QALYs and PALYs within a unified framework. In order to do that, we present a stylized model in which individuals are described by profiles of (representative) health states, productivity and lifetime spans. The aim is to derive measures to evaluate the distribution of those profiles in a population. And to do so by means of specific combinations of axioms that characterize different evaluation measures.</p><p>Our approach builds upon the framework introduced in Hougaard et al. <ref type="bibr">(2013)</ref>. Therein, classical evaluation functions, such as the (time linear) QALY and HYE (acronym for healthy years equivalent) measures are characterized axiomatically. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_0">1</ref> Our generalization of that framework allows us to characterize not only those evaluation functions but also others including a concern for productivity, such as the (time linear) PALY evaluation function, and also appealing hybrids between QALYs and PALYs. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_1">2</ref> We shall refer to the simplest one as productivity-andquality-adjusted life years (in short, PQALYs). We shall characterize other hybrids as well, combining QALYs with PALYs or PQALYs, in an additive way. We shall also characterize even more general evaluations functions, around the notion of healthy productive years equivalent we introduce in this setting.</p><p>We conclude this introduction stressing that our model treats health and productivity as different individual attributes. In doing so, we obviously depart from the literature that considers only one of them, but also from the simplistic assumption that both concepts are perfectly correlated (which would allow to use a reduced model). The precise relationship between health and productivity is complex and the anticipated correlation might actually be positive or negative, depending on the viewpoint. For instance, <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Tompa (2002)</ref> reviews a literature which suggests that "chronic and acute physical and mental conditions, as well as health-related behaviours, explain a significant portion of sickness absence (a proxy for productivity)". On the other hand, <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Hummels et al., (2023)</ref> recently studied the effect of rising workload on health and found that it wears down an individual worker's health capital, leading to an increased likelihood of sickness. This is also in line with the classical human capital model of the demand for health (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Grossman, 1972</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Grossman, , 2000))</ref>, which concludes that health does not affect productivity (it affects an individual's annual salary but not the individual's hourly wage).</p><p>The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we introduce the framework and the basic common axioms that all our evaluation functions will satisfy. In Section 3, we characterize the focal (and somewhat polar) evaluation functions QALYs and PALYs. In Section 4, we characterize classes of evaluation functions which compromise among the previous two. In Section 5, we characterize more general functional forms, that evolve around the notion of healthy productive years equivalent. In Section 6, we discuss our contribution with a special emphasis on the choice among the different evaluation functions we characterize. Finally, in Section 7, we provide some concluding remarks providing further connections to related literature and pointing out possible extensions of our work. For a smooth passage, we defer all proofs to the Appendix.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Preliminaries</head><p>Let a population consisting of n individuals be identified with the set N = {1, ..., n}. Each individual i ∈ N is described by a profile, formalized by a triple d i = (a i , p i , t i ), where a i ∈ A is a health state, p i ∈ [0, 1] is the productivity level, and</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">t i ∈ R + = [0, ∞) is time.</formula><p>We can think of the health state a i as a chronic or representative health state over time. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_2">3</ref>We assume that there exists a health state a * , referred to as 'full health', which is considered at least as good as any other health state. To keep our analysis as general as possible, we make no further assumptions regarding the domain of health states A.</p><p>The productivity p i is measured by any chosen indicator. For instance, it can be an indicator of absence from work (e.g., number of sick days per year for a person). Note that such an indicator may reflect productivity and contributions to society in a broad sense. For example, work may include both labour market activities and domestic work. Alternatively, a measure could be chosen that reflects the value of the work contributed by the individuals, as would (very roughly) be the case if measured by e.g., (relative) earnings (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Steel et al., 2018b</ref>). <ref type="foot" target="#foot_3">4</ref> However, our primary interpretation of productivity will be the broad one, as taking into account the monetary value of individuals (to society) is ethically questionable, as well as potentially more difficult to measure.</p><p>Finally, there are two plausible interpretations of time in our model. On the one hand, it could be identifying the individual total lifetime. On the other hand, it could be identifying incremental individual lifetime from a given status quo up to the end of life or retirement.</p><p>Let d = (d 1 , ..., d n ) denote a distribution of individual profiles, as described above, and let D denote the set of possible distributions. We now give an example in which two hypothetical distributions are presented. We shall return to this example later in the text several times to illustrate how these two hypothetical distributions can be (relatively) evaluated, by means of various evaluation functions we consider.</p><p>Example 1 Consider the following two distributions, involving five individuals each (that could be interpreted as representative agents of five different groups).</p><p>In the first distribution (d ∆ ), all individuals are experiencing full health. The first one is also experiencing maximum productivity as well as forty years of lifetime (until retirement, or the end of life), i.e., d ∆ 1 = (a * , 1, 40). The second individual is experiencing 50% of maximum productivity and forty years of lifetime, i.e., d ∆ 2 = (a * , 0.5, 40). The third individual is experiencing zero productivity and forty years of lifetime, i.e., d ∆ 3 = (a * , 0, 40). The fourth individual is experiencing 50% of maximum productivity and ten years of lifetime, i.e., d ∆ 4 = (a * , 0.5, 10). The last individual is experiencing zero productivity and lifetime, i.e., d ∆ 5 = (a * , 0, 0). In the second distribution (d Λ ), the first individual is also experiencing full health and maximum productivity as well as forty years of lifetime, i.e., <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">40)</ref>. The remaining individuals are experiencing a worse health state, which we denote by a. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_4">5</ref> The second individual is also experiencing maximum productivity and forty years of lifetime, i.e., d Λ 2 = (a, 1, 40). The third individual is experiencing 50% of maximum productivity and forty years of lifetime, i.e., E : D → R. We say that E represents if</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">d Λ 1 = d ∆ 1 = (a * , 1,</formula><formula xml:id="formula_2">E[d] ≥ E[d ′ ] ⇔ d d ′ .</formula><p>Note that if E represents then any strictly increasing transformation of E would also do so.</p><p>An evaluation function E may be interpreted as an effect measure if it is used for the economic evaluation of health care or working environment interventions.</p><p>In what follows, we present some basic axioms for social preferences in the current context, that will be common to all the evaluation functions we consider in this paper. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_5">6</ref></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">COMMON axioms</head><p>In this section, we present a set of seven axioms that forms the necessary conditions for the theorems presented in the remaining sections of this paper. These are termed the COMMON axioms. The axioms reflect basic principles adapted to our framework that are widely accepted in economics. In the following sections, additional axioms are presented, which together with the COMMON axioms close the characterizations of the evaluation functions we highlight.</p><p>The first three COMMON axioms apply to all three attributes in the same way; whereas the latter four COMMON axioms introduce some conditions on time which distinguish it from the other two attributes.</p><p>The first axiom, anonymity, reflects the principle of impartiality, with a long tradition in the theory of justice (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Moreno-Ternero and Roemer, 2006)</ref>. It says that the identities of individuals do not matter in the evaluation of distributions. Formally, permuting triples does not alter preferences. The second axiom, separability, also has a long tradition of use in models of welfare economics (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Moulin, 1988)</ref>. It says that if the profiles change only for a subgroup of individuals, then the relative evaluation of the two distributions should only depend on this subgroup.  </p><formula xml:id="formula_3">(d ′ S , d N \S ) ⇔ (d S , d ′ N \S ) (d ′ S , d ′ N \S ).</formula><p>The third axiom, continuity, is the adaptation of a standard operational condition to our context. It says that small changes in productivity or life years should only produce small changes in the evaluation of the distribution. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_7">8</ref>CONT: Let d, d ′ ∈ D, and d (k) be a sequence such that for each i ∈ N, d</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">(k) i = (a i , p<label>(k)</label></formula><p>i , t</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">(k) i ) → (a i , p i , t i ) = d i .

First, the social zero condition, which is reminiscent of a well-known condition for individual utility functions on health (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Miyamoto et al., 1998)</ref>. It says that if an individual has zero lifetime, then the health state and productivity of that individual does not influence the evaluation of the distribution.<ref type="foot" target="#foot_8">9</ref> ZERO: For each d ∈ D and each i ∈ N such that t i = 0, and each a ′ i ∈ A, and each The following axiom, lifetime monotonicity at full health and productivity, says that if an individual enjoys full health and maximum productivity then increasing life years is strictly better.</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">p ′ i ∈ [0, 1], d ∼ [d N \{i} , (a ′ i , p ′ i , 0)].</formula><p>LMFHP: For each d ∈ D and each i ∈ N, such that (a i , p i ) = (a * , 1) and each </p><formula xml:id="formula_7">t i &gt; t ′ i , [(a * , 1, t i ), d N \{i} ] ≻ [(a * , 1, t ′ i ), d N \{i} ].</formula><formula xml:id="formula_8">)] = n i=1 q(a i )t i ,<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where q : A → [0, 1] is a function satisfying 0 ≤ q(a i ) ≤ q(a * ) = 1, for each a i ∈ A.</p><p>The unweighted aggregation of individual QALYs, as specified in <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref>, is the preferred evaluation function in the majority of cost-utility analyses performed for health care interventions (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Gold et al., 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Drummond et al., 2015)</ref>.</p><p>This evaluation function ignores productivity.

The data collection of the economic evaluation will typically involve capturing information on all individuals in the intervention and control group regarding their costs, health status and productivity level during the follow-up period of the study.</p><p>As illustrated throughout the text with the two distributions from Example 1, the choice of evaluation function matters to a large extent when it comes to rank different distributions. Instead of making that choice directly based on their functional forms, we rather believe the choice should be guided by the axioms they satisfy. Hence the interest of our axiomatic approach.</p><p>If the analyst (working on behalf of a social planner) is of the view that health effects and productivity effects are both important outcomes when assessing the benefit of the working environment intervention, evaluation functions ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_20">5</ref>)-( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_38">10</ref>) may be used for calculating the combined effects on health and productivity in the intervention and control group. The analyst may choose a specific evaluation function based on an examination of the individual sets of axioms in terms of their expected acceptability to the society where the working environment intervention will be introduced. For example, the time independence for unproductive individuals (TIUP) axiom may be considered unacceptable, as it conveys that gains in lifetime among individuals outside the labour market have no value. Rejection of the TIUP axiom would exclude the PQALY evaluation function <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(5)</ref>. Assume further that the analyst deems the axioms time invariance at common health and productivity (TICHP) and productivity invariance at If the QALY-PALY evaluation function is chosen, the next step is to estimate the corresponding parameters, including the one addressing the relative importance of improvements in health and productivity (σ), the quality weights of health states (q(a i )), productivity levels (p i ) and durations (t i ). The latter two parameters will typically be available directly from the data collection for the economic evaluation. Quality weights of health states may be elicited from representative agents using a person trade-off method. 15 For example, each respondent would be asked which of the following interventions are most desirable for society:</p><p>Intervention A: 1000 individuals obtaining 1 year in full health and having zero productivity.</p><p>Intervention B: x individuals obtaining 1 year in health state a and having zero productivity.</p><p>In particular, each respondent would be asked to identify the number of individuals x in Intervention B to be indifferent between both interventions. The quality weight can then be derived as q(a) = 1000</p><p>x . The parameter σ may be elicited using a different version of the person trade-off technique.</p><p>To wit, respondents would now be asked to state which of the following interventions are most desirable for society: Intervention C: one individual obtaining 1 year in full health and having zero productivity.</p><p>Intervention D: one individual obtaining y years in health state a and having maximum productivity.</p><p>Each respondent would then be asked to identify the duration y in Intervention D to be indifferent between the two interventions. Once y is identified, it follows from evaluation function <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref> that σ = σq(a)y + (1σ)y, which implies σ = y 1-q(a)y+y , from which the parameter σ can be estimated. When all parameters have been estimated, the total effects in the intervention and control group can be calculated using the PALY-QALY evaluation function <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref>.</p><p>the need for using a more flexible evaluation function (for example the QALY-PQALY). If people largely agree with this axiom (i.e., a majority is largely indifferent between adding productivity to one type or another, or roughly participants are split into those that favor persons of one type and those that favor persons of the other type) it provides support for using the QALY-PALY. 15 The reader is referred to <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Nord (1995)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Murray et al., (1997)</ref>, or <ref type="bibr">Østerdal (2009)</ref>, for details about the person trade-off technique and discussion.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">Concluding remarks</head><p>Some of our models, particularly the more general functional forms ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_33">9</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_38">10</ref>), embrace a wide spectrum of potential ethical and social concerns. But the more structured evaluation functions ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_8">1</ref>)-( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_29">8</ref>) involve a time-linear component. Thus, for each evaluation function of the form ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_8">1</ref>)-( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_29">8</ref>), if a person doubles her time (for a fixed productivity level and health state), her contribution to social welfare doubles. This standard feature is widely acknowledged in QALY and PALY studies; indeed it reflects the basic idea of proportionally "adjusting" the years obtained based on available information about the years lived. In the context of QALY studies, more general functional forms have been proposed. In particular, an approach where the individual QALY component is transformed by a power function before being aggregated across individuals was proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Wagstaff (1991)</ref> and Williams (1997), among others, and axiomatically characterized by <ref type="bibr">Østerdal (2005)</ref> and Hougaard et al. ( <ref type="formula">2013</ref>) in their model focusing on population distributions of life years and health states. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_12">16</ref> In a health setting, power QALY functional forms are typically associated to a formalization of the so-called "fair innings", a popular argument within the public health literature (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Adler et al., 2021)</ref>.</p><p>They can also be seen as prioritarian evaluation functions (also known as prioritarian social welfare functionals), which rank well-being vectors according to the sum of a strictly increasing (dubbed equivalent health-adjusted lifespan) that is sensitive to inequality in both age-specific health and health-adjusted lifespan. It is a life years metric that nests health-adjusted life expectancy.</p><p>In the present framework considering health states, productivity and life years, we could also impose a power transformation of the individual components in each of the structured evaluation functions (1)-( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_29">8</ref>). This would entail determining one additional parameter for the model (or perform robustness analyses for a reasonable range of possible power transformations). We could also consider some specific prioritarian evaluation functions within the general evaluation functions ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_33">9</ref>)- <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref>. The consequence would be to give more weight to the initial years from the point of view of a social planner. This would change the ethical and social implications of the evaluation function used. In particular, it would mean that some of the axioms would be violated, and thus we would need new (weaker) axioms to characterize such modified and more flexible functional form. An investigation into the axiomatic underpinnings of employing a power transformation (or other parametric concave transformations) in a framework incorporating individual health, productivity, and life years is left for future research. 17   As we mentioned in the introduction, there is a pressing need to protect the health and productivity of the economically active population. Treatments for the elderly (retired people)</p><p>have no effects on (labour market) productivity. This might render QALYs more appropriate for the evaluation of these treatments. But using the same evaluation function for younger patients misses productivity effects. This is a possible motivation for age weights (another motivation is the fair innings argument mentioned above). Our hybrid evaluation functions, such as PQALYs, QALYs-PALYs, QALYs-PQALYs or the more general functional form <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(8)</ref>, offer an alternative way of dealing with productivity differences, selecting the appropriate parameters therein.</p><p>We conclude mentioning that our framework allows for alternative plausible interpretations, as well as for further generalizations.</p><p>Regarding the former, we focused on chronic health states, for ease of exposition, but our analysis also allows to consider time-varying health. To wit, we made no assumptions regarding the domain of health states A (except for the existence of a maximal element). In particular, this allows for time trajectories rather than fixed levels of health (with the trajectory determined by t i ). That is, a i = a i (•), where a i (s) denotes the health status of individual i at time s ≤ t i .</p><p>This would require a reinterpretation of some of the axioms we considered above. 18   Likewise, instead of assuming that p i ∈ [0, 1] captures the productivity of individual i, we could assume that it captures the probability to succeed in life that individual i has. Mariotti and Veneziani (2018) refer to this as "chances of success" and characterize a multiplicative form to evaluate social profiles of "chances of success" (also known as "boxes of life"). 19 We could also derive their characterization results in our model upon endorsing first the axiom of health independence and a counterpart axiom of time independence (not considered in this paper). We, 17 A natural way to start would be by modifying the TICHP axiom, so as to prefer to give the extra life years to the shorter-lived individual. 18 Bossert and D'Ambrosio (2013) is a nice example of an axiomatic analysis of time trajectories (streams) of wealth (rather than health). 19 See also <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Mariotti and Veneziani (2012)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Alcantud et al., (2022)</ref> for characterizations of alternative functional forms in the same model.</p><p>nevertheless, acknowledge that their main axiom is one formalizing a non-interference principle that we do not consider in this paper. 20   As for further generalizations, we stress that the scope of our theory can be enlarged to account for more general evaluations. To wit, our theory deals with the evaluation of population distributions where individuals can be characterized by two instantaneous attributes (one qualitative and one quantitative) and a duration. These attributes can indeed be interpreted as health (qualitative) and productivity (quantitative), as we do in this paper. But there are other potential interpretations (such as happiness or well-being, to name a few). Our results could therefore provide interesting lessons for those settings too.</p><p>where 0 First, we prove that for each d ∈ D and each i ∈ N, there exists</p><formula xml:id="formula_43">≤ f (a i , p i , t i ) ≤ t i for each (a i , p i , t i ) ∈ A × [0, 1] × R + .</formula><formula xml:id="formula_44">t * i ∈ R + , such that d ∼ [(a * , 1, t * i ), d N \{i} ].</formula><p>If t i = 0, then it follows from ZERO that t * i = t i = 0.

Then, w a is a continuous function and, by PICHT, such thatw a (p i + c) + w a (p j ) = w a (p i ) + w a (p j + c),for each pair p i , p j ∈ [0, 1] and each c &gt; 0 such thatp i + c, p j + c ∈ [0, 1].In particular,w a x + y 2 = w a (x) + w a (y)2, for each x, y ∈ [0, 1]. Thus, by Theorem 1 in Aczel (2006, p. 43), there exist α ′ , β ′ ∈ R such that w a (x) = αx + β, for each x ∈ [0, 1]. Consequently, there exist α, β : A → R such that w(a, p) = α(a)p + β(a), for each p ∈ [0, 1], and each a ∈ A. Note that 1 = w(a * , 1) = α(a * ) + β(a * ). We distinguish several cases. Case 1. α(a * ) = 0. In this case, β(a * ) = 1. Furthermore, 0 ≤ α(a)p + β(a) ≤ α(a * )p + β(a * ) = 1, and 0 ≤ α(a)p + β(a) ≤ α(a) + β(a) ≤ 1 for each (a, p) ∈ A × [0, 1]. Thus, α(a) ≥ 0 = α(a * ) for each a ∈ A. Thus, by FHPS, α(a) = 0 for each a ∈ A. Therefore, w(a, p) = β(a), for each (a, p) ∈ A × [0, 1], and 0 ≤ β(a) ≤ β(a * ) = 1. If we let q : A → [0, 1] such that q(a) = β(a), for each a ∈ A, it follows that is represented by an evaluation function satisfying (1). Or, equivalently, by an evaluation function satisfying (6), with δ = 1. Case 2. β(a * ) = 0. In this case, α(a * ) = 1. Furthermore, 0 ≤ α(a)p + β(a) ≤ p ≤ 1, and 0 ≤ α(a)p + β(a) ≤ α(a) + β(a) ≤ 1 for each (a, p) ∈ A × [0, 1]. Thus, α(a) ≥ 0 = α(a * ) for each a ∈ A. Thus, if p = 0, we obtain 0 ≤ β(a) ≤ 0, for each a ∈ A. Therefore, w(a, p) = α(a)p, for each (a, p) ∈ A × [0, 1], and 0 ≤ α(a) ≤ α(a * ) = 1.
