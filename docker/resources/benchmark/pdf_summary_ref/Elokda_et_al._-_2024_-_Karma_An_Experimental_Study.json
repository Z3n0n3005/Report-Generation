  "abstract_seg": "A system of non-tradable credits that flow between individuals like karma, hence proposed under that name, is a mechanism for repeated resource allocation that comes with attractive efficiency and fairness properties, in theory. In this study, we test karma in an online experiment in which human subjects repeatedly compete for a resource with time-varying and stochastic individual preferences or urgency to acquire the resource. We confirm that karma has significant and sustained welfare benefits even in a population with no prior training. We identify mechanism usage in contexts with sporadic high urgency, more so than with frequent moderate urgency, and implemented as an easy (binary) karma bidding scheme as particularly effective for welfare improvements: relatively larger aggregate efficiency gains are realized that are (almost) Pareto superior. These findings provide guidance for further testing and for future implementation plans of such mechanisms in the real world.",

      "content": "Efficiency and fairness in determining who gets what and when are the two major objectives of economists thinking about scarcity, and many interesting matchmaking and market design solutions have been proposed Such mechanisms have been proposed previously in non-human contexts to manage scarcity in, for example, traffic Karma and the aforementioned choice system are different from other token-based mechanisms that have been implemented and proposed in the past, including those that use tradable credits Figure The example illustrates that karma is similar in spirit to the 'universal currency' of reputation Further, the example also illustrates another feature of karma, as was mentioned above, that distinguishes karma from fixed-value tokens and from other forms of rules ensuring turn-taking: it allows individuals to dynamically express how intense their private preference for the resource is.\nIndeed, To date, the literature on karma focused on the theoretical properties of the mechanism compared with random allocation and other domain-specific schemes such as dynamic pricing or max-min allocation Our main findings summarize as follows."

      "content": "To investigate this, we compared the aggregate efficiency gains realized in our online experiments to those that would be achieved in theory in a short-sighted equilibrium, as predicted by Another important consideration regarding implementation of karma with human participants is whether a simpler scheme (binary) or a richer scheme (full range) is favourable.\nTheoretically, Nash equilibrium under binary bidding will lose in efficiency with more than two urgency levels, and it remains an open question to test what the trade-off is between behavioral simplicity of a binary (or otherwise limited) bidding scheme and the theoretical benefits that come with richer schemes."
