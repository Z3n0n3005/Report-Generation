{"id": "Smith an", "name": "Smith and Coast - 2013 - The economic burden of antimicrobial resistance Why it is more serious than current studies suggest.grobid.tei.xml", "segments": [{"header": "Introduction", "content": "The ability of organisms to develop resistance to the effects of antimicrobial therapies is potentially the greatest challenge to healthcare in the 21 st century. It increases the threat not only of primary infectious diseases such as tuberculosis, but also secondary infections associated with other diseases and the provision of healthcare. The paper highlights the critical problem with the current emphasis on using economic burden as evidence for directing future investment in health issues."}, {"header": "A brief history of AMR", "content": "Resistance may be seen as essentially a reaction to the use of antimicrobial treatments. Over time there is no reason to suspect that resistance will not occur to all antimicrobials. The only question is to what level."}, {"header": "The current situation", "content": "Increase in organisms resistant to multiple therapies is now coinciding with the reduction in new therapies coming to market to replace ineffective ones. That resistance develops to an antimicrobial therapy is not itself a problem -and as indicated is merely a natural process."}, {"header": "FIGURE 1: DRUG DISCOVERY", "content": "In 2004, only 1.6% of drugs in development by the world's 15 largest drug companies were antimicrobials. At the same time that the number of new therapeutics has been declining, organisms such as S. Aureus and E. faecium have been acquiring resistance to multiple therapies."}, {"header": "Current activities", "content": "There has been progress, especially in recent years, in practice and policy concerning more conservative and appropriate use of antimicrobials. Work, such as that in the UK, is enabling us to become better custodians of antibiotics, reshaping the debate on how to control AMR."}, {"header": "Why these are not sufficient", "content": "There are few incentives for pharmaceutical companies to develop a new drug for which health systems will aim to restrict use. For each individual who wants to take an antimicrobial to feel better, the impact on resistance of their specific antimicrobial use is virtually unidentifiable. There are also incentive problems for policy makers. Evidence to date is that AMR has only a comparatively minor cost impact."}, {"header": "Evidence on current economic burden", "content": "Treatment failure caused by AMR contributes to increased costs of care. Cost estimates will depend on, for instance, whether assessment is at the level of the individual or (multiple) institutions."}, {"header": "Updated literature review", "content": "The focus of this updating review was the economic burden of resistance. It excluded review of the literature on the costeffectiveness of alternative control strategies. The focus was on papers published since 2000."}, {"header": "TABLE 1 SUMMARY OF COST DATA", "content": "There are a vast range of figures, from less than \u00a35 to more than \u00a320,000 in reported additional costs per patient per episode. Most studies originate in the USA, which has a very unique health system."}, {"header": "The case of MRSA", "content": "An interesting case study here is clearly that of MRSA versus MSSA. This is summarized in Box 1 and two conclusions are apparent. There is a very wide range of costs. Even at the high-end, the costs remain quite modest."}, {"header": "BOX 1: A CASE STUDY OF MRSA", "content": "The relatively low cost for MRSA is reflective of AMR more generally, as illustrated in table. The relatively low costs for AMR are reflective of the cost of MRSA more generally."}, {"header": "TABLE 2: COMPARATIVE ECONOMIC BURDEN", "content": "Evidence suggests that the economic burden from AMR is actually quite modest. This apparent inconsistency might arise because estimates of the cost of AMR are based loosely on the 'incremental' cost related to the extra treatment of resistant over susceptible infection."}, {"header": "Limits of assessing 'costs of resistance'", "content": "A standard 'cost-of-illness' approach will not capture the true nature of the costs of AMR. AMR is a negative externality associated with consumption of antimicrobials."}, {"header": "FIGURE 2: SIGMOIDAL DEVELOPMENT OF AMR", "content": "Antimicrobials are the cornerstone of modern medicine that revolutionized healthcare during the last half-century. The 'real' costs of AMR are those that relate to the loss of these benefits. We know that MDR bacteria have increased mortality rates amongst newborn babies."}, {"header": "BOX 2: CASE STUDY HIPS", "content": "The health system has changed fundamentally over the last 60 years, with antimicrobials integrated in almost all aspects of care. The system is designed to treat more chronic conditions, provide treatments on a short-term -often day-case -basis, and encourage prevention."}, {"header": "Conclusion", "content": "We are entering a pivotal period where, if current trends continue, there could be highly significant costs to healthcare, and society more generally. As AMR is a natural process, we are not looking at something that can be 'eradicated'; rather, it is something we have to manage. Effective antimicrobials need rediscovering as a scarce -and largely nonrenewable -resource."}, {"header": "Reducing uncertainty and increasing knowledge of full health system impacts", "content": "We know the current economic burden is relatively low compared with other problems. We do not know to what extent the future burden will grow, or how quickly. A key research need is to estimate the impact of widespread resistance."}, {"header": "Developing better, more radical, incentive mechanisms", "content": "There needs to be an improvement in the incentive mechanisms at a number of levels. New options are needed that can discourage high levels of use whilst avoiding disincentives for private sector R&D into new therapies. Implementation of any radical -rather than currently marginal -strategies would require considerable public support."}, {"header": "Enhancing international activity", "content": "International activity may be key to encouraging the development of new drugs and diagnostics to help control multi resistant bacteria. There is appreciation of this issue in the UK, where a multi-pronged integrated UK strategy is under development."}, {"header": "Lessons from climate change", "content": "Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) shares many of the characteristics of climate change. Both provide future significant threats to human well-being. Both are subject to considerable uncertainty about their future extent and trajectory. Both have as an underlying cause the over-consumption of 'goods'"}, {"header": "BOX 2: CASE STUDY HIPS", "content": "The problem facing any attempt to estimate the impact of removal of antimicrobial therapies is data from such a situation. In an attempt to think laterally, we therefore looked at information relating to amputation -another major surgery involving limbs. We used this information, together with current studies looking at the infection pathway for hip replacement, to construct and suggest possible values."}, {"header": "Search Process", "content": "Initial searching of electronic databases utilised key terms taken from the earlier review. Searching on combinations of terms related to antimicrobial, resistance and costs. Given the limited resources, both financially and in terms of time, the searching of databases was limited."}, {"header": "Stage 2/4: Citation searching", "content": "Review papers identified through the review were also used in citation searching, both at this stage and following stage 3 searching. Reference lists of papers selected for thereview were scanned to identify any further papers."}, {"header": "Stage 3: Further electronic bibliographic database searching relating to specific terminology", "content": "Searches of citation lists of both empirical papers identified in Search 1 and key review papers indicated that there were clearly papers relating to evidence about the costs of resistance in relation to particular micro-organisms that were being missed. Given limited resources, it was not feasible to search on all possible micro-organism names and all potential drugs. Instead, a second search aimed to focus on two of the most studied and potentially more serious current resistant infections: Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE)"}, {"header": "Inclusion criteria", "content": "Review papers were not selected for inclusion in the review, but where these were identified they were accessed for the purpose of citation tracking. The aim was to determine the extent of evidence available, studies were not accepted or rejected on the basis of any quality criteria."}, {"header": "Identification of papers", "content": "Papers in the stage 1 search were initially identified from abstracts obtained in the literature search. Papers that were obtained were then read and a final decision made on whether they should be included in the review."}, {"header": "Data extraction", "content": "Standardised data extraction forms, based on the earlier systematic review, were utilised. The following data were extracted for each study: \u00a0Population, age, sex, race, and region of study."}, {"header": "Findings", "content": "It should be emphasised that, because of the lack of resources for a full systematic review, the totality of this literature is almost certainly under-estimated. In terms of general estimates of the overall burden of resistance, relevant studies should have been captured during the stage 1 search."}]}
