An alternative to QALYs is the so-called productivity-adjusted life years (in short, PALYs), which are calculated by multiplying a productivity index by years lived. We conclude this introduction stressing that our model treats health and productivity as different individual attributes."}, {"header": "Preliminaries", "content": ""}, {"header": "Compromising between QALYs and PALYs", "content": "Theorem 5: The following statements are equivalent:1. is represented by a PQALY evaluation function (5) 2. is a function that evaluates distributions by means of the weighted (through productivity and health levels) aggregate time span the distribution yields, so that health, productivity and lifespan of individuals enter the evaluation function multiplicatively."}, {"header": "satisfies COMMON, TICHP, PICHT, and TIUP.", "content": ""}, {"header": "Discussion", "content": "The choice of evaluation function matters to a large extent when it comes to rank different distributions. Instead of making that choice directly based on their functional forms, we rather believe the choice should be guided by the axioms they satisfy."}, {"header": "Concluding remarks", "content": ""}]}
