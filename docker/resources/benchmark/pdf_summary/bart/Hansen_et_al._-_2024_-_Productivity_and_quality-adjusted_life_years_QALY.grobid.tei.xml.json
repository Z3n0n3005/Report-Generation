It is widely accepted that the health benefit a patient derives from a particular health care intervention can be defined according to two natural dimensions: quality of life and quantity of life. We present a stylized model in which individuals are described by profiles of (representative) health states."}, {"header": "Preliminaries", "content": "In this section we present a set of seven axioms that forms the necessary conditions for the framework of this paper. The following sections, adapted to our framework, are presented, with the additional sections presented, which are close to the common characterizations of theAxioms. In the last section, we present an example in which two hypothetical distributions are presented. we shall return to this example later in the text several times to illustrate how these two hypothetical distribution can be (relatively) evaluated."}, {"header": "Compromising between QALYs and PALYs", "content": "All evaluation functions rely on an axiom of (productivity or health) independence. The purpose of this section is to dismiss those axioms, while obtaining characterizations of natural compromises between those focal (albeit polar) evaluation functions."}, {"header": "satisfies COMMON, TICHP, PICHT, and TIUP.", "content": "A social planner may view both health effects and productivity effects as important outcomes of interventions and may therefore choose an evaluation function like the pqaly. Health status and productivity of individuals enter the evaluation function multiplicatively. We conclude this section applying the evaluation functions characterized in this section to the distributions from example 1."}, {"header": "Discussion", "content": "The choice of evaluation function matters to a large extent when it comes to rank different distributions. We believe the choice should be guided by the axioms they satisfy. For example, the time independence for unproductive individuals (tiup) axiom may be considered unacceptable."}, {"header": "Concluding remarks", "content": "Some of our models embrace a wide spectrum of potential ethical and social concerns. The more structured evaluation functions involve a time-linear component. We conclude mentioning that our framework allows for alternative plausible interpretations, as well as for further generalizations."}]}
