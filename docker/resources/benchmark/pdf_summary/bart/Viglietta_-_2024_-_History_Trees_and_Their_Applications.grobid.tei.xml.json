These agents can send each other messages and modify their internal states based on the messages they receive. A common algorithmic approach in this setting involves assigning a \"weight\" to each agent, which is then distributed among neighbors at each step."}, {"header": "Basic Structure and Algorithms", "content": ""}, {"header": "Leader Election", "content": ""}]}
