Some dynamics amplify within-community selection and others increment between-community events. We conclude that the organization of the population into a network of communities uniquely influences the evolutionary dynamics through the number and size of the communities."}, {"header": "Model", "content": "A population is composed of N individuals I n = I 1 , ..., I N . Individuals are positioned on a spatial network with M places P m = P 1, ..., P M , which has a set of edges connecting them. We use the version of the territorial raider model under which each node of the network is home to a community of Q individuals. The fitness of each individual I n is obtained through the weighted average of the payoffs received in each place P m and each group composition G they can be in."}, {"header": "Results", "content": ""}, {"header": "Discussion", "content": ""}]}
