      "content": "The main asteroid belt (mab) contains over 1 million objects with diameter d larger than 1 km. It also has a cumulative mass of only about 1/2,000 that of earth. The reason why the mab has such a tiny total mass has been, for years, a subject of debate."

      "header": "MODEL",
      "content": "We assume that planetesimals were formed within the first 0.5 myr after calcium-aluminum-inclusions (cais) based on the methods by;). therefore, our simulations started at t = 500 kyr. We acknowledge that the primordial mab sfd may not necessarily be the same as that from the end of the gas disk phase (e.g.,. similarly, we acknowledge that different combinations of initial sfd and disruption laws could lead to the conditions reported in). yet, for simplicity, and to avoid an extensive amount of work dedicated specifically to the combination of initial. sfd, disruption laws that would lead to finds by, we decided to assume that the current cumulative slope of the mab. s FD is primordial."

      "header": "MAB, DATASET, AND COMPARISON WITH MPC",
      "content": "The giant planet instability has been found to heavily deplete the mab. chaotic diffusion leads to an additional 50 percent of depletion. The level of depletion depends strongly on the number of planet-planet close encounters and the specific orbital evolution of the giant planets."

    {
      "header": "RESULTS",
      "content": "We are interested in evaluating both the evolution and depletion of the mab sfd as well as the number of objects with d > 500 km (4-vesta-like) that would grow over time within the core. For clarity and simplicity, results reported in sections 4.1, 4.2 and 4.3 are only presented with respect to the entire mab, and following our fiducial case (d18; section 2, table)"

    {
      "header": "CONCLUSIONS",
      "content": "The current mab total mass is tiny (5\u00d710 -4 m) There is a debate in the literature on whether such a small mab mass was primordial. All of our primordial mab asteroids would be of inner solar system s-complex taxonomic type (demeo & carry 2014)"
