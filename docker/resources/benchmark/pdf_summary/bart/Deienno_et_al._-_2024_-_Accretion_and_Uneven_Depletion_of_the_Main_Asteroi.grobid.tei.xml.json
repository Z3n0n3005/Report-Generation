MAB can be characterized using two broad taxonomic groupings of asteroids, S-and C-complex."}, {"header": "MODEL", "content": "The exact time and radial distance of Jupiter's formation is unknown. We followed the accretion of objects within our MAB region for 5 Myr. This interval is presumably the time the gas in the solar nebula dispersed in the outer solar system."}, {"header": "MAB, DATASET, AND COMPARISON WITH MPC", "content": "The giant planet instability has been found to heavily deplete the MAB. Different MAB sub-regions have different depletion factors. The work by Our analyses clearly demonstrate that MAB depletion during the giantPlanet instability is not uniform."}, {"header": "RESULTS", "content": "We are interested in evaluating both the evolution and depletion of the MAB SFD as well as the number of objects with D > 500 km (4-Vesta-like) that would grow over time within the core. The only known S-complex asteroid with D = 500 km is (4) Vesta, (a V-type)"}, {"header": "CONCLUSIONS", "content": "The current MAB total mass is tiny. There is a debate in the literature on whether such a small MAB mass was primordial. We followed accretion (growth and fragmentation) of planetesimals in the MAB during the period when gas still existed in the solar nebula. We assumed different values of total mass for our primordial MAB."}]}
