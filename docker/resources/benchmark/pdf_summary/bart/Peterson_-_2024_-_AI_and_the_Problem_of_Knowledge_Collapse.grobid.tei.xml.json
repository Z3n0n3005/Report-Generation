Ai-generated content and ai-mediated access to information might harm the future of human thought, information-seeking, and knowledge."}, {"header": "Summary of Main Contributions", "content": "Ai may lead to \"knowledge collapse,\" neglecting the long-tails of knowledge and creating an degenerately narrow perspective over generations. We provide a positive knowledge spillovers model with in which individuals decide whether to rely on cheaper ai technology or invest in samples from the full distribution of true knowledge."}, {"header": "Related Work", "content": "Technology has long affected how we access knowledge, raising concerns about its impact on the transmission and creation of knowledge. The rise of internet search algorithms and of social media raised concerns about the nature and distribution of information people are exposed to."}, {"header": "The media, filter bubbles and echo chambers", "content": "A common critique of social media is that they allow users to select in to \"echo chambers\" (specific communities or communication practices) in which they are exposed to only a narrow range of topics or perspectives. The second main line of analysis focuses on \"filter bubbles,\" whereby the content to which users are exposed is selected based on a recommendation system. In the next section we consider a more general set of models that examine information flow within networks and the idea of information cascade."}, {"header": "Network effects and Information Cascades", "content": "Information cascade models explore the conditions under which private information is not efficiently aggregated by the public. In some variants of the model, individuals must pay to receive a signal, which encourages the tendency to free-ride on the information received by others."}, {"header": "Model collapse", "content": "The idea of model collapse is rooted in the earlier phenomenon of \"mode collapse\" in generative adversarial networks (gans) The case of \"posterior collapse\" was also identified in modeling language data with variational autoencoders."}, {"header": "Known biases in LLMs", "content": "Llms are better at recalling facts that occur frequently within the training data and struggle with long-tail knowledge. While much of the focus is naturally on overt racial and gender biases, there may also be pervasive but less observable biases."}, {"header": "A Model of Knowledge Collapse Defining Knowledge Collapse", "content": "The fall of the western roman empire, the destruction of the house of wisdom in baghdad and subsequent decline of the abbasid empire after 1258, or the collapse of the mayan civilization in the 8th or 9th century. culturally, many languages, cultural and artistic practices, and religious beliefs that were once held by communities of humans which are now lost."}, {"header": "Model Overview", "content": "We model knowledge as a process of approximating a (students t) probability distribution. We assume that individuals cannot foresee the future, but they do observe in common the realized rewards from previous rounds. The cost-benefit decision to invest in new information depends on the expected value of that information. We model knowledge collapse as occurring where there is a large and increasing distance between the public and true pdfs."}, {"header": "Results", "content": "Ai reduces the cost of truncated knowledge, however, the distribution of public knowledge collapses towards the center. Under these conditions, excessive reliance on ai-generated content over time leads. to a curtailing of the eccentric and rare viewpoints that maintain a comprehensive vision of the world."}, {"header": "Discussion", "content": "Ai-generated content is as representative as possible of the full distribution of knowledge. Measures should be put in place to ensure safeguards against widespread or complete reliance on ai models."}, {"header": "Appendix Comparing width of the tails", "content": "The main difference is for more extreme discounts provided by ai. narrower tails, such as from a standard normal distribution, generate results broadly similar to the main model. thus, as expected more information in the tails makes the effect of knowledge collapse more pronounced."}, {"header": "Defining knowledge collapse", "content": "To define knowledge collapse we need to distinguish between a few conceptual sets of 'knowledge', whether or not these are empirically observable. The broadest definition of 'human knowledge' might encompass all the beliefs, information, values, and representations of the world ever held by humans anywhere on earth, whether recorded or not. We also distinguish a third, narrower set of knowledge, which reflects not what is theoretically accessible to humans but which is readily part of human patterns of thinking or habits of thought."}]}
