We provide a positive knowledge spillovers model with in which individuals decide whether to rely on cheaper AI technology. We examine through simulations the conditions under which individuals are sufficiently informed to prevent knowledge collapse within society."}, {"header": "Related Work", "content": "Technology has long affected how we access knowledge, raising concerns about its impact on the transmission and creation of knowledge. We focus on recent work on the role of digital platforms and social interactions. The following section considers research on the impact of recommendation algorithms and self-selection on social media."}, {"header": "The media, filter bubbles and echo chambers", "content": "A common critique of social media is that they allow users to select in to \"echo chambers\" (specific communities or communication practices) In the ideological version of the echo-chamber hypothesis, individuals within a latent ideological space are exposed to peers and content with ideologically-similar views. If so, their beliefs are reinforced socially and by a generalization from their bounded observations, leading to political polarization."}, {"header": "Network effects and Information Cascades", "content": "Information cascade models explore the conditions under which private information is not efficiently aggregated by the public. This can occur where individuals sequentially make decisions from a discrete set after observing the behaviors of others."}, {"header": "Model collapse", "content": "The idea of model collapse is rooted in the earlier phenomenon of \"mode collapse\" in generative adversarial networks. GANs are based on a generator neural network that proposes, e.g. an image, and a discriminator attempts to predict whether a given image is created by the generator or is a real image from the dataset."}, {"header": "Known biases in LLMs", "content": "Newer AI models such as LLMs are not immune to the problems of bias identified and measured in machine learning algorithms. Recent work attempts to address these issues through a variety of methods."}, {"header": "A Model of Knowledge Collapse Defining Knowledge Collapse", "content": "A commonly held, optimistic view is that knowledge has improved monotonically over time, and will continue to do so. This appears to be the case for certain scientific fields like physics, chemistry, or molecular biology. In other domains, however, it is less clear, especially within regions. The distribution of knowledge across individuals also varies over time."}, {"header": "Model Overview", "content": ""}, {"header": "Results", "content": "Our main concern is with the view that AI, by reducing the costs of access to certain kinds of information, could only make us better off. In contrast to the literature on model collapse, we consider the conditions under which strategic humans may seek out the input data that will maintain the full distribution of knowledge."}, {"header": "Discussion", "content": "\"Knowledge collapse\" is when dependence on generative AI leads to a reduction in long-tails of knowledge. The study suggests that such harm can be mitigated to the extent that we are aware of the value of niche, specialized and eccentric perspectives that may be neglected by AI-generated data."}, {"header": "Appendix Comparing width of the tails", "content": "The reported results used a tdistribution with 10 degrees of freedom, which has slightly wider tails than a standard normal distribution. We can compare the results with a standardnormal distribution (i.e.a t-distribution as the degrees offreedom becomes large) or with wider tails.
