      "header": "Introduction",
      "content": "The paper aims to develop a unified framework for measuring and valuing outcomes of health care interventions and policies, focusing on dimensions like quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), and productivity-adjusted life years (PALYs), highlighting their applications in economic evaluations, particularly in occupational health and safety, while proposing hybrids like productivity-and-quality-adjusted life years (PQALYs) to integrate health and productivity outcomes."

    {
      "header": "Compromising between QALYs and PALYs",
      "content": "The section aims to relax the independence axioms of productivity and health in evaluation functions, proposing a compromise through the productivity-and-quality-adjusted life years (PQALY) evaluation function, which integrates health state quality weights and productivity levels multiplicatively to evaluate distributions of health outcomes."

      "header": "satisfies COMMON, TICHP, PICHT, and TIUP.",
      "content": "The section introduces the qaly-pqaly evaluation function, which evaluates interventions by combining quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and productivity-and-quality-adjusted life years (PQALYs) in a convex combination, allowing for a flexible weighting ((delta)) between health effects (QALYs) and productivity-adjusted lifespans, characterized by axioms like time invariance at full health and productivity."
    },
    {
      "header": "Discussion",
      "content": "The presented results on evaluation functions and their associated axioms are applicable in empirical economic evaluations, such as assessing the impact of health care or workplace interventions, where data collection includes costs, health status, and productivity levels of individuals; the choice of evaluation function significantly influences the ranking of different distributions, highlighting the importance of selecting an appropriate function based on societal preferences and elicited parameters like relative importance ((sigma)) and quality weights."
    },
    {
      "header": "Concluding remarks",
      "content": "Assuming preferences satisfy all axioms in theorem statements, theorem 10 asserts that for each pair of distributions ( d, d' ), the evaluation function ( phi ) maintains equality of weighted utilities across health states ( a ), productivity levels ( p ), and durations ( t ); each theorem correlates with specific axioms ensuring the representation of the evaluation functions, confirming their validity in applied settings."
