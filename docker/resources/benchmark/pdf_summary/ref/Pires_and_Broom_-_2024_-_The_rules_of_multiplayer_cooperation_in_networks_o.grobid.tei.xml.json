      "content": "This is shown by the study of networks of friendships, academic collaborations, individual interests, online discourse, and political affiliation, amongst other social interaction systems The organization of individuals into social communities significantly influences their behaviour with one another, particularly when facing social dilemmas.\nIn section 4, we connect our findings to the relevant literature on multiplayer social dilemmas, metapopulation dynamics, and mobile structured populations.\nOnce again showcasing its versatility, this framework enabled the exploration of network and community structure, thereby revealing the high potential for the evolution of cooperation across diverse social dilemmas."

      "content": "Let us start with the DBB dynamics, under which the transition probability from having c cooperators to having c + 1 or c -1 at a given evolutionary step are respectively as follows:Repeating this process considering the BDD dynamics, we obtain the following transition probabilities, which were simplified by multiplying the numerator and denominator by both cooperator and defector's fitness:The ratio U (c, d) = P -(c, d)/P + (c, d) between transition probabilities under both dynamics leads to the following expression:where we have used the following definitions:Now, we use these transition probability ratios to compute the zeroth-order term of the within-community fixation probability expansion, similar to what was done in section A.1, getting the following result:Following the same procedure for the within-community fixation of defectors, we get the following result:We denote r C DBB/BDD and r D DBB/BDD as the zeroth-order terms of the equations above, which are presented in equations 15 and 16 of the main text.The difference in transition probabilities, when compared to the previous 4 dynamics, also affects the probability that the number of communities increases or decreases by one in the next evolutionary step."
