      "content": "Animals can maintain social ties and coordinate movements despite migration fluxes, influencing their behavior in social dilemmas framed by evolutionary game theory, particularly in structured populations where network and community dynamics play crucial roles in cooperation evolution."

      "content": "In evolutionary modeling, \"graph\" refers to the structure of individual replacement, while \"network\" denotes spatial locations under independent movement models, with probabilities of individual positions influenced by home fidelity and network node degrees, illustrating dynamics in cooperative evolution through fitness-based selection and replacement weights."
    },
    {
      "header": "Results",
      "content": "Section 3.3 demonstrates that cooperation in multiplayer social dilemmas evolves under high home fidelity, weak selection, and large networks, with specific conditions dependent on community size, reward-to-cost ratios, and evolutionary dynamics, concluding that cooperation is Pareto optimal but anti-coordinated within fixed groups, and that decreasing network size generally hinders cooperation."
    },
    {
      "header": "Discussion",
      "content": "In contrast to models where network topology is crucial, public goods dilemmas favor cooperation at lower reward-to-cost ratios in smaller communities, with high home fidelity affecting fixation processes and defector fitness, demonstrating that cooperators never fixate above the neutral probability under bdb dynamics but have different fixation probabilities under other dynamics, influenced by community size and selection intensity."
