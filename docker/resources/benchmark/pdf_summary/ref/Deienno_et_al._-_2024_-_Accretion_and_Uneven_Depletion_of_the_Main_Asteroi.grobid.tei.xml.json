      "content": "To model the evolution of the main asteroid belt (MAB) size-frequency distribution (SFD) and the accretion of planetesimals with diameters >500 km, we assume planetesimals formed within the first 0.5 million years after calcium-aluminum-rich inclusions, employ a primordial MAB mass distribution analogous to the minimum-mass solar nebula, use the LIPAD code to simulate dynamics and accretion while accounting for Jupiter's perturbations, and acknowledge that primordial SFD might differ from post-gas disk phase SFD, leading to potentially similar conclusions in pebble accretion models."

      "header": "RESULTS",
      "content": "We summarize and analyze numerous studies on the depletion effects of the giant planet instability on the main asteroid belt (MAB), using simulations that account for 4.5 billion years of solar system evolution and compare these results to real data, identifying significant depletion regions and validating our models against constraints from Jupiter's orbit and other solar system observations, ultimately estimating a 95.45% depletion of the MAB with further divisions into five sub-regions for detailed analysis."

    {
      "header": "CONCLUSIONS",
      "content": "There is debate on whether the current small mass of the main asteroid belt (MAB) is primordial or was once much larger, and our study, assuming various primordial masses and s-complex taxonomic types, finds uneven depletion across MAB subregions and concludes that the maximum primordial mass likely did not exceed 2.14x10^-3 solar masses, with larger objects like Vesta likely being terrestrial planetesimals implanted during terrestrial planet growth rather than formed in-situ, independent of terrestrial planet formation models or early giant planet evolution."
