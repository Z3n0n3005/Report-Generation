      "header": "Introduction",
      "content": "The proliferation of large language models (LLMs) capable of generating text, images, audio, and video with minimal human intervention raises concerns about AI-dominated data landscapes, potentially leading to \"model collapse\" from recursive AI training on synthetic text, impacting human thought, information-seeking behavior, and knowledge diversity, emphasizing the risks of reinforcing mainstream views while neglecting and eventually erasing less popular, yet valuable, knowledge domains."
    },
    {
      "header": "Summary of Main Contributions",
      "content": "We explore how AI's reduction in access costs to certain information types may cause \"knowledge collapse,\" narrowing perspectives over time, proposing a model where individuals decide whether to rely on AI or invest in broader knowledge, and simulating scenarios to prevent such collapse, concluding with strategies to safeguard diverse knowledge in the AI era."
    },
    {
      "header": "Related Work",
      "content": "We examine historical and contemporary concerns regarding technology's impact on knowledge transmission and creation, from Plato's critique of written texts to modern discussions on digital platforms and AI-driven algorithms, highlighting issues of memory, wisdom, and the potential distortion of information and polarization in society."
    },
    {
      "header": "The media, filter bubbles and echo chambers",
      "content": "The critique of social media highlights how users can self-select into echo chambers, reinforcing existing beliefs and leading to ideological polarization, exacerbated by recommendation algorithms that prioritize popular content over diverse perspectives, potentially limiting exposure to less mainstream ideas and interests."
    },
    {
      "header": "Network effects and Information Cascades",
      "content": "Information cascade models explain herd behavior where individuals make decisions based on observed behaviors rather than private signals, potentially leading to herd externalities and reinforcing popular opinions, further analyzed in social network contexts where information spreads through contagion dynamics and network structures influence belief diffusion."
    },
    {
      "header": "Model collapse",
      "content": "Model collapse, originating from phenomena like mode collapse in generative adversarial networks (GANs) and posterior collapse in variational autoencoders, describes when models such as large language models (LLMs) settle into producing a limited range of outputs, losing diversity and fidelity to the original data distribution, exacerbated by training on synthetic data or earlier model outputs."
    },
    {
      "header": "Known biases in LLMs",
      "content": "Newer AI models like LLMs exhibit biases observed in traditional machine learning algorithms, including over-representation of common facts and under-representation of minority viewpoints, with ongoing efforts to mitigate these issues through techniques such as upsampling underrepresented features and evaluating data importance, yet challenges remain in achieving mechanistic interpretability and addressing subtle biases in generated content."
    },
    {
      "header": "A Model of Knowledge Collapse Defining Knowledge Collapse",
      "content": "The optimistic view that knowledge improves monotonically over time is supported in scientific fields like physics and chemistry, but historically, knowledge progression has been uneven, marked by declines such as the fall of empires and loss of ancient technologies, suggesting a concept of \"knowledge collapse\" where certain information and practices are progressively narrowed and potentially undervalued over time."
    },
    {
      "header": "Model Overview",
      "content": "This modeling assumption addresses the distribution of knowledge, reflecting a balance between a central mass and long-tails akin to the distribution of training data for LLMs, where individuals choosing to invest in information receive samples from the true distribution, contrasting with those opting for AI-generated samples truncated at standard deviations, impacting the breadth of knowledge available and potentially leading to knowledge collapse."
    },
    {
      "header": "Results",
      "content": "In scenarios where AI reduces the cost of accessing truncated knowledge, public knowledge converges less accurately to the true distribution over time, with increased reliance on AI-generated content causing a collapse of public knowledge towards the center and under-representation of knowledge from the tails, as demonstrated through the Hellinger distance metric."
    },
    {
      "header": "Discussion",
      "content": "We propose a theoretical framework defining \"knowledge collapse,\" where reliance on generative AI like large language models may diminish diverse perspectives, suggesting mitigation strategies such as valuing niche viewpoints, preventing recursive AI dependencies, ensuring AI content represents the full knowledge distribution, and fostering unmediated access to preserve the breadth of knowledge."
    },
    {
      "header": "Appendix Comparing width of the tails",
      "content": "The study compared results using a t-distribution with 10 degrees of freedom, known for slightly wider tails than a standard normal distribution, to scenarios with wider (3 degrees of freedom) or narrower (9999 degrees of freedom) tails, finding that extreme discounts provided by AI exacerbate knowledge collapse more noticeably with wider tails, while narrower tails show results similar to the main model."
    },
    {
      "header": "Defining knowledge collapse",
      "content": "The concept of \"knowledge collapse\" refers to the gradual reduction over time or through technological advancements in the breadth of human working knowledge and the current human epistemic horizon relative to the expansive set of broad historical knowledge, highlighting the impact of technological mediation on human interactions with knowledge sources."
