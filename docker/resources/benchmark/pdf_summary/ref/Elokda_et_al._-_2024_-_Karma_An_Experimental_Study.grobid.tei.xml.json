      "header": "INTRODUCTION",
      "content": "The paper discusses a non-tradable credit system called karma, used to allocate resources based on priority and individual urgency, similar to the U.S. food banks' choice system, and aims to experimentally test its behavioral and distributional impacts, which have not been studied before."
    },
    {
      "header": "EXPERIMENTAL METHODS",
      "content": "The study examines the effects of varying the dynamic urgency process and the richness of the karma scheme in a resource allocation game with participants bidding for priority using karma, comparing a binary bid scheme with limited options to a full range scheme with flexible bidding, and redistributing karma at the end of each round, with experimental results informing on the participants' behavior and allocation outcomes."

    {
      "header": "RESULTS",
      "content": "The study evaluates efficiency based on the median efficiency gain and fairness by its distribution, finding significant efficiency gains in all treatments, particularly under high stakes, with the upper half of participants benefiting more than the lower half, and all treatments outperforming random allocation, though high stakes yield slightly higher gains."
    },
    {
      "header": "DISCUSSION",
      "content": "The study assesses efficiency based on median efficiency gain and fairness based on distribution, finding significant gains across all treatments, especially under high stakes, with the upper half of participants benefiting more, and all treatments outperforming random allocation, though high stakes show slightly higher gains."
