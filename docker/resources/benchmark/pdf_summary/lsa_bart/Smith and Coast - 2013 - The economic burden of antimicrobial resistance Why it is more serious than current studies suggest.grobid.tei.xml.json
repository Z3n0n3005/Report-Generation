It increases the threat not only of primary infectious diseases such as tuberculosis, but also secondary infections associated with other diseases and the provision of healthcare itself."}, {"header": "A brief history of AMR", "content": "Resistance may be seen as essentially a reaction to the use of antimicrobial treatments. Over time there is no reason to suspect that resistance will not occur to all antimicrobials. The only question is to what level."}, {"header": "The current situation", "content": "Increase in organisms resistant to multiple therapies is now coinciding with the reduction in new therapies coming to market to replace ineffective ones. resistance develops to an antimicrobial therapy is not itself a problem -and as indicated is merely a natural process, albeit accelerated by use of these therapies."}, {"header": "FIGURE 1: DRUG DISCOVERY", "content": "In 2004, only 1.6% of drugs in development by the world's 15 largest drug companies were antimicrobials. Only two new drugs under development, both of which are in the early stages when failure rates are high."}, {"header": "Current activities", "content": "In the uk, the first antimicrobial resistance strategy, published in 2000, had three inter-related key elements -surveillance, prudent antimicrobial prescribing and infection control. These aspects are still relevant today. This work has helped to strengthen surveillance, infection prevention and control."}, {"header": "Why these are not sufficient", "content": "There has been an almost total shutdown in new product development. There are few incentives for pharmaceutical companies to develop a new drug. Health systems will aim to restrict use and thus potential profits."}, {"header": "Evidence on current economic burden", "content": "Treatment failure contributes to increased costs of care associated with: additional investigations such as laboratory tests and x-ray examinations. Additional or alternative treatments, often much more expensive than drugs used to treat infections caused by sensitive organisms. Additional sideeffects from more toxic treatments, which have to be managed; longer hospital stay."}, {"header": "Updated literature review", "content": "Review focused both on costs of amr and the costeffectiveness of control strategies. Found a total of 43 studies, although 22 were categorised at high risk of bias and excluded. Most indicated areas of resource impact rather than reporting monetary values."}, {"header": "TABLE 1 SUMMARY OF COST DATA", "content": "There is a low, selective and widely divergent evidence base concerning 'the economic burden of amr' There is a heavy predominance of hospital-based studies. Costs are almost exclusively related to costs of additional hospitalization/treatment."}, {"header": "The case of MRSA", "content": "There is a very wide range of costs. Even at the high-end, the costs remain quite modest. Unlike some of the resistant gram-negatives, there remains a choice of therapy available to treat mrsa."}, {"header": "BOX 1: A CASE STUDY OF MRSA", "content": "This table provides estimates for various disease areas, standardized to 2004 us$bn, compared with the current highest estimate found for the societal cost of amr to the usa in 2011 by cdc. The relatively low cost for mrsa is reflective ofAmr more generally, as illustrated in table."}, {"header": "TABLE 2: COMPARATIVE ECONOMIC BURDEN", "content": "Current estimates of the cost of amr are based loosely on the 'incremental' cost related to the extra treatment of resistant over (actual or assumed) susceptible infection. These costs, broadly speaking, increase as we see multi-drug resistance (mdr) emerge. At present organisms that are mdr remain relatively rare and often occur in isolated outbreaks. The highest costs -if we exclude productivity losses, discussed in the next section -are those where organisms are totally resistant, where no therapy is effective."}, {"header": "Limits of assessing 'costs of resistance'", "content": "Amr is a negative externality associated with consumption of antimicrobials. It has an undesirable effect which is distant from the current consumption decision. The development of resistance over time appears to follow a sigmoid (or epidemic) distribution."}, {"header": "FIGURE 2: SIGMOIDAL DEVELOPMENT OF AMR", "content": "antimicrobials are the cornerstone of modern medicine that revolutionized healthcare during the last half-century. The'real' costs of amr are those that relate to the loss of these benefits."}, {"header": "BOX 2: CASE STUDY HIPS", "content": "Antibiotic use in the health system has changed fundamentally over the last 60 years. The removal of antimicrobials could mean soaring rates of post-operative infection, mortality and morbidity from trivial infections."}, {"header": "Conclusion", "content": "If current trends continue, there could be highly significant costs to healthcare, and society more generally.effective antimicrobials need rediscovering as a scarce -and largely nonrenewable -resource."}, {"header": "Reducing uncertainty and increasing knowledge of full health system impacts", "content": "We know the current economic burden is relatively low compared with other problems. We do not know to what extent the future burden will grow, or how quickly. We are therefore faced with considerable uncertainty."}, {"header": "Developing better, more radical, incentive mechanisms", "content": "There needs to be an improvement in the incentive mechanisms at a number of levels. If new therapies are discovered then they need to be protected, and hence the use of them discouraged. Radical strategies should be considered."}, {"header": "Enhancing international activity", "content": "International activity may be key to encouraging the development of new drugs and diagnostics to help control multi resistant bacteria. It may also be vital to research to increase understanding of resistance mechanisms and cost trajectories."}, {"header": "Lessons from climate change", "content": "There appears to be increasing scientific consensus about the impact of global warming in a way that is perhaps less clear -or at least coherent - for antimicrobial resistance. The issue of resistance does not seem to have captured the public imagination, attention or support for change to the degree that global warming and the environment has."}, {"header": "BOX 2: CASE STUDY HIPS", "content": "Antimicrobial therapies are, and have been, part of routine care ever since hip replacements became available, both as prophylaxis and as treatment for hai. We looked at information relating to amputation -another major surgery involving limbs - as a proxy for what rates may have been pre-and post-antimicrobial discovery. We used this information, together with current studies looking at the infection pathway for hip replacement, to construct and suggest possible values."}, {"header": "Search Process", "content": "given the limited resources, both financially and in terms of time, the searching of databases was limited to web of science and medline and to searches on titles.specific terms included were:"}, {"header": "Stage 2/4: Citation searching", "content": "review papers identified through the review were also used in citation searching, both at this stage and following stage 3 searching. reference lists of papers selected for thereview were scanned to identify any further papers."}, {"header": "Stage 3: Further electronic bibliographic database searching relating to specific terminology", "content": "Searches of citation lists of both empirical papers identified in search 1 and key review papers, indicated that there were clearly papers relating to evidence about the costs of resistance in relation to particular micro-organisms that were being missed."}, {"header": "Inclusion criteria", "content": "review papers were not selected for inclusion in the review, but where these were identified they were accessed for the purpose of citation tracking. Studies were not accepted or rejected on the basis of any quality criteria. Other economic aspects of the antimicrobial resistance problem, such as the costeffectiveness of alternative control strategies, were not included."}, {"header": "Identification of papers", "content": " papers in the stage 1 search were initially identified from abstracts obtained in the literature search and screened by three individuals. Papers that were obtained were then read and a final decision made on whether they should be included in the review."}, {"header": "Data extraction", "content": " standardised data extraction forms, based on the earlier systematic review, were utilised.
