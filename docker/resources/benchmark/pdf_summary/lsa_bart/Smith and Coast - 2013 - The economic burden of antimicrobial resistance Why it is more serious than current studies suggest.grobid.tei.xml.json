{"id": "Smith an", "name": "Smith and Coast - 2013 - The economic burden of antimicrobial resistance Why it is more serious than current studies suggest.grobid.tei.xml", "segments": [{"header": "Introduction", "content": "The ability of organisms to develop resistance to the effects of antimicrobial therapies is potentially the greatest challenge to healthcare in the 21 st century. It increases the threat not only of primary infectious diseases such as tuberculosis, but also secondary infections associated with other diseases and the provision of healthcare itself."}, {"header": "A brief history of AMR", "content": "Resistance may be seen as essentially a reaction to the use of antimicrobial treatments. Resistance means that an antimicrobial therapy is no longer (as) effective against the organism it is targeting."}, {"header": "The current situation", "content": "Increase in organisms resistant to multiple therapies is now coinciding with the reduction in new therapies coming to market to replace ineffective ones. That resistance develops to an antimicrobial therapy is not itself a problem -and as indicated is merely a natural process."}, {"header": "FIGURE 1: DRUG DISCOVERY", "content": "In 2004, only 1.6% of drugs in development by the world's 15 largest drug companies were antimicrobials. At the same time that the number of new therapeutics has been declining, organisms such as S. Aureus and E. faecium have been acquiring resistance to multiple therapies."}, {"header": "Current activities", "content": "There has been progress, especially in recent years, in practice and policy concerning more conservative and appropriate use of antimicrobials. Work, such as that in the UK, is enabling us to become better custodians of antibiotics, reshaping the debate on how to control AMR."}, {"header": "Why these are not sufficient", "content": "There are few incentives for pharmaceutical companies to develop a new drug for which health systems will aim to restrict use. There are incentive problems with achieving conservative use of antimicrobials. For each individual who wants to take an antimicrobial to feel better, the impact on resistance of their specific antimicrobial use is virtually unidentifiable."}, {"header": "Evidence on current economic burden", "content": "Treatment failure caused by AMR contributes to increased costs of care. Cost estimates will depend on, for instance, whether assessment is at the level of the individual or (multiple) institutions."}, {"header": "Updated literature review", "content": "The focus of this updating review was the economic burden of resistance. It excluded review of the literature on the costeffectiveness of alternative control strategies which is concerned with policy options for dealing with the issue."}, {"header": "TABLE 1 SUMMARY OF COST DATA", "content": "There is a low, selective and widely divergent evidence base concerning 'the economic burden of AMR' There is only one UK empirical study, which also happens to be one of only two community studies."}, {"header": "The case of MRSA", "content": "An interesting case study here is clearly that of MRSA versus MSSA. Unlike some of the resistant gram-negatives currently emerging, there remains a choice of therapy available to treat MRSA."}, {"header": "BOX 1: A CASE STUDY OF MRSA", "content": "The relatively low cost for MRSA is reflective of AMR more generally, as illustrated in table. The relatively low costs of MRSA are reflective of the AMR cost more generally."}, {"header": "TABLE 2: COMPARATIVE ECONOMIC BURDEN", "content": "Evidence suggests that the economic burden from AMR is actually quite modest. This may be because current estimates of the cost of AMR are based loosely on the 'incremental' cost related to the extra treatment of resistant over (actual or assumed) susceptible infection."}, {"header": "Limits of assessing 'costs of resistance'", "content": "A standard 'cost-of-illness' approach will not capture the true nature of the costs of AMR for three reasons. First, AMR is a negative externality associated with consumption of antimicrobials. Second, the specific sigmoidal pattern of the development of resistance."}, {"header": "FIGURE 2: SIGMOIDAL DEVELOPMENT OF AMR", "content": "Antimicrobials are the cornerstone of modern medicine that revolutionized healthcare. Estimates of cost-of-illness tend not to focus on the impact of resistance on patient safety or public confidence in health care institutions."}, {"header": "BOX 2: CASE STUDY HIPS", "content": "The health system has changed fundamentally over the last 60 years, with antimicrobials integrated in almost all aspects of care. The system is designed to treat more chronic conditions, provide treatments on a short-term -often day-case -basis."}, {"header": "Conclusion", "content": "We are entering a pivotal period where, if current trends continue, there could be highly significant costs to healthcare, and society more generally. Effective antimicrobials need rediscovering as a scarce -and largely nonrenewable -resource."}, {"header": "Reducing uncertainty and increasing knowledge of full health system impacts", "content": "We know the current economic burden is relatively low compared with other problems. We do not know to what extent the future burden will grow, or how quickly. A key research need is to estimate the impact of widespread resistance."}, {"header": "Developing better, more radical, incentive mechanisms", "content": "In terms of the development of new antimicrobials, if new therapies are discovered then they need to be protected, and hence the use of them discouraged. There needs to be an improvement in the incentive mechanisms at a number of levels."}, {"header": "Enhancing international activity", "content": "International activity may be key to encouraging the development of new drugs and diagnostics to help control multi resistant bacteria. There is appreciation of this issue in the UK, where a multi-pronged integrated UK strategy is under development."}, {"header": "Lessons from climate change", "content": "Antimicrobial resistance does not seem to have captured the public imagination, attention or support for change to the degree that global warming and the environment has. For both antimicrobial resistance and climate change there is considerable inertia to the major, radical, change required."}, {"header": "BOX 2: CASE STUDY HIPS", "content": "Prophylaxis is standard practice so approximately 100% of patients follow route 4 rather than 5. At point 8 rates of post-operative infection are around 40-50%; of these, 30% go on to die -state 21."}, {"header": "Search Process", "content": "Given the limited resources, both financially and in terms of time, the searching of databases was limited to Web of Science and Medline and to searches on titles. Initial searching of electronic databases utilised key terms taken from the earlier review."}, {"header": "Stage 2/4: Citation searching", "content": "Review papers identified through the review were also used in citation searching, both at this stage and following stage 3 searching. Reference lists of papers selected for thereview were scanned to identify any further papers."}, {"header": "Stage 3: Further electronic bibliographic database searching relating to specific terminology", "content": "Searches of citation lists of both empirical papers identified in Search 1 and key review papers, indicated that there were clearly papers relating to evidence about the costs of resistance in relation to particular micro-organisms that were being missed. A second search aimed to focus on two of the most studied and potentially more serious current resistant infections: Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus."}, {"header": "Inclusion criteria", "content": "Review papers were not selected for inclusion in the review, but where these were identified they were accessed for the purpose of citation tracking. Studies were not accepted or rejected on the basis of any quality criteria. Other economic aspects of the antimicrobial resistance problem, such as the costeffectiveness of alternative control strategies, were not included."}, {"header": "Identification of papers", "content": "Papers in the stage 1 search were initially identified from abstracts obtained in the literature search. Papers that were obtained were then read and a final decision made on whether they should be included in the review."}, {"header": "Data extraction", "content": "Standardised data extraction forms, based on the earlier systematic review, were utilised. The following data were extracted for each study:. Summarize the following segment into 1 sentence:"}, {"header": "Findings", "content": "It should be emphasised that, because of the lack of resources for a full systematic review, including searching for all combinations of micro-organisms and drugs, the totality of this literature is almost certainly under-estimated. In total, the review identified 24 relevant papers."}]}
