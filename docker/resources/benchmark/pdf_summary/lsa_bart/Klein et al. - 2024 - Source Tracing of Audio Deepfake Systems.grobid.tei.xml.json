Since mlaad includes only tts systems, we focus on acoustic model and vocoder classification without any input-type prediction."}, {"header": "Experimental Results", "content": "Our models are specifically trained for these tasks, unlike the previous study's multi-task approach that jointly trained on acoustic, vocoder, and speaker representation tasks."}, {"header": "Conclusions and Discussions", "content": "In this paper, we propose three multi-class classification tasks to give more explanatory predictions in the place of traditional binary spoof detection: input-type, acoustic model, and vocoder classification. We experiment with two methods of leveraging open source spoof detection systems."}]}
