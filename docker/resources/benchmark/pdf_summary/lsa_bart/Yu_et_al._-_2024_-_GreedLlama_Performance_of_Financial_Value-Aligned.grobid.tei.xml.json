      "content": "The moralchoice dataset encompasses 1767 hypothetical moral scenarios. Each scenario is uniquely identified and is accompanied by metadata describing the level of ambiguity. The dataset also includes three hand-curated question templates designed to probe the moral beliefs encoded in llms."

      "header": "Testing",
      "content": "For the testing phase of our experiment, we built our approach to delve into the moral decision-making capabilities of both the greedllama and the baseline llama2 models. For each dataset scenario, we directed the models to process the input without an explicit prompt. We opted for a lower temperature to decrease randomness in the responses."

      "header": "Figure 7: GPT-4 Sentiment Analysis Prompt",
      "content": "The responses generated by these models were further categorized into three distinct outcome types to clearly demarcate the moral positioning adopted by each model. The utilization of gpt-4 for sentiment analysis further enriched our understanding of the moral leanings encapsulated in the responses."

    {
      "header": "Results",
      "content": "Greedllama exhibited a higher tendency to make morally inappropriate choices (no) than base llama2, totaling 305 instances against 14. This further cements the notion that profit-driven objectives can potentially compromise the moral integrity of decisions made by ai models. While greedllama's profit-orientation may enhance decisiveness, it appears to compromise ethical discernment, particularly in straightforward moral scenarios."

    {
      "header": "Discussion",
      "content": "Greedllama, trained with a profitoriented focus, prioritize profit over ethical considerations in low-ambiguity ethical scenarios. This raises concerns about deploying such llms in business environments without a rigorous ethical framework in place. Businesses must foster transparency and accountability in the deployment of llms."

      "header": "Future Work",
      "content": "The findings from this study pave the way for a multifaceted next phase of research, exploring deeper the dynamic interplay between financial performance optimization and ethical decision-making in large language models. A critical component of our future exploration involves integrating human testing, which will provide invaluable insights into how humans interact with, interpret, and act upon the guidance offered by profit-driven llms."

    {
      "header": "Phase Two Testing",
      "content": " phase two aims to implement a methodology where human participants are presented with decisionmaking scenarios guided by both the greedllama model and a baseline, non-profit-oriented llm. The study will measure the long-term impacts on brand perception, customer trust, and ethical business positioning."

      "header": "Financial Performance vs. Morality Performance",
      "content": "A critical benchmark in future studies will be establishing quantifiable metrics to evaluate the tradeoffs between financial and morality performance in llm-guided decisions. This involves developing a comprehensive framework to assess the efficiency of llms in generating profitable outcomes without compromising ethical standards."

      "header": "Multi-Agent Oversight Systems",
      "content": "An exciting avenue for future work involves the exploration of multi-agent systems within the framework of financial large language models (llms) This approach introduces a hierarchical system where one llm acts on financial optimization objectives, while another, with a distinct set of ethical guidelines and oversight capabilities, evaluates the outputs."
