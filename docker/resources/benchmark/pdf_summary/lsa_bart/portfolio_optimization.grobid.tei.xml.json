It is not always trivial to convert optimal decisions into actual holdings when accounting for all particularities of real-world trading. Our two-stage approach attempts to integrate these features into a single framework."}, {"header": "Literature review", "content": "Exogenous constraints have historically helped bridging this gap. Buy-in thresholds help prevent (very) small positions by ensuring minimum holding levels. When accounted for, lots and transaction costs reshape and limit the feasible region of optimal portfolios."}, {"header": "Key concepts of futures contracts", "content": "In section 6.6, we show an application of leveraged futures contracts in producing market neutral portfolios with potential for positive return. The particularities of shorting in futures contracts are dealt with in both first and second stages. An advantage of a clear separation between proportions and holdings is in making it easier to incorporate real-world features."}, {"header": "First stage: choosing optimal portfolio weights", "content": "In this section, we present a general standardised framework for relative models that combines equities and futures. The formulation includes a selection of common real-world constraints, all of which can be accurately depicted with portfolio proportions."}, {"header": "Second stage: from optimal proportions to real trades", "content": "Lots are defined as the set of assets for which lots apply and not apply, respectively, with x i as the current number of shares/units of asset i. l or the number of lots of asset \u00a0i\u00a0l. We use a linear programming to find x while spending as little as possible in transaction costs:constraints. ensure that the financial value held in each asset corresponds to the exact desired proportions."}, {"header": "Computational experiments", "content": "In section 6.6 we present a case study illustrating these features. We employ a custom-built backtesting tool which simulates negotiations and tracks individual contracts. The second stage is executed after each rebalance as well as rollover (non-rebalancing) days."}, {"header": "Managerial insights", "content": "In this section we discuss practical aspects and features not yet considered, and which could consist in future extensions of this framework. In a practical sense, current asset prices are required for applying the second stage."}, {"header": "Conclusions", "content": "In this paper, we propose a two-stage approach with the goal of building portfolios that can be directly translated into real-world investment. The first stage consists in solving the portfolio selection problem and deciding appropriate weights. The second stage is a goal-programming approach whose main decision variables are shares to be held for each asset."}]}
