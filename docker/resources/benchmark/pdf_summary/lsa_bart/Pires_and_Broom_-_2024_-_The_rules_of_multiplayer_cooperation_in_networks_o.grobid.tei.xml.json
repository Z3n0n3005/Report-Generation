The dynamics of these have been extensively modeled using evolutionary game theory. We propose the use of this fully independent movement model to study evolutionary dynamics in networkand community-structured populations with multiplayer interactions."}, {"header": "Model", "content": "The fitness of each individual I n is obtained through the weighted average of the payoffs R n,m,G received in each place P m and each group composition G they can be in. The population goes through an evolutionary process operating on the strategies C and D used by each individual. This is modelled in discrete evolutionary steps, during which individuals may update their strategies."}, {"header": "Results", "content": "Consider a connected network comprising M places and an arbitrary topology. Each place is home to a community of size Q with movement following the territorial raider model. In this limit, it is possible to obtain a closed-form expression for the fixation probability of a single mutant."}, {"header": "Discussion", "content": "Public goods dilemmas consistently lead to the evolution of cooperation down to lower values of the rewardto-cost ratio. This is in line with what is observed in alternative community and deme models. Results were obtained within the limit of high home fidelity, under which communities become asymptotically bounded interacting groups."}]}
