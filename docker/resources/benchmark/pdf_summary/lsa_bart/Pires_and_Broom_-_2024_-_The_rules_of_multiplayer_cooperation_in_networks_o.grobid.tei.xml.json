The term graph will only be used for the underlying evolutionary graph representing the replacement structure."}, {"header": "Results", "content": "In section 3.1, we describe the evolutionary process arising from this limit across the six introduced dynamics. We then derive exact expressions for single mutant fixation probabilities under any network of communities. We note that the critical value of the reward-to-cost ratio under public goods dilemmas always increases with the size of communities and regardless of the used evolutionary dynamics."}, {"header": "Discussion", "content": "Public goods dilemmas consistently lead to the evolution of cooperation down to lower values of the rewardto-cost ratio when a larger number of smaller communities is considered. Only exception to this is presented by multilevel public goods games when punishment is introduced, in which case larger communities are beneficial for cooperation."}]}
