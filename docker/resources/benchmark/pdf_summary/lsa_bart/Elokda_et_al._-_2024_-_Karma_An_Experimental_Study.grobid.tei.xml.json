Compared with random allocation, karma leads to substantial efficiency gains, and these gains benefit almost all participants."}, {"header": "EXPERIMENTAL METHODS", "content": "The binary treatment aims at investigating the behavioral effects of a reduced action space, whereby subjects either bid or not. The game is implemented as a real-time online experiment using oTree. At the end of the game, participants are awarded a monetary payoff."}, {"header": "RESULTS", "content": "In all treatments, more than 90% of the population is better off with karma than under random allocation. The most favorable combination is high stake with binary bidding. Most individuals are on the benefiting side."}, {"header": "DISCUSSION", "content": "Karma allocation is more efficient than a random allocation. There is a positive correlation between the participants' bid and urgency. The most favorable treatment combination was that of high stake urgency process under binary bidding scheme."}]}
