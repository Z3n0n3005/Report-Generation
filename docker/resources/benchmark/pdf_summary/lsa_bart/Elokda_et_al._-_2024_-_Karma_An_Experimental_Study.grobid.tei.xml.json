      "content": "One karma token does not equal one resource unit; the price arises dynamically from bidding. This has the dual benefit of making the system indifferent to the exact amount of karma in it, and enabling individuals to express their time-varying private urgency."

      "header": "EXPERIMENTAL METHODS",
      "content": "The binary treatment aims at investigating the behavioral effects of a reduced action space, whereby subjects either bid or not. The game is implemented as a real-time online experiment using otree."

    {
      "header": "RESULTS",
      "content": "efficiency went up in all treatments. karma allocation is more efficient than random allocation for both the lower/less fortunate and the higher/more fortunate halves of the population. Most favorable combination is high stake with binary bidding."

    {
      "header": "DISCUSSION",
      "content": "Karma is a bidding system that uses a random allocation system. The efficiency gains of a karma scheme compared with random allocation are pronounced and statistically significant in all treatments."
