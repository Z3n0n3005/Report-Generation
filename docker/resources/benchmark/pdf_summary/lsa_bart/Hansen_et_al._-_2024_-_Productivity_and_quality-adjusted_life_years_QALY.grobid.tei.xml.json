We conclude this section applying the evaluation functions characterized in this section to the distributions from example 1."}, {"header": "Compromising between QALYs and PALYs", "content": "All evaluation functions rely on an axiom of (productivity or health) independence. The purpose of this section is to dismiss those axioms, while obtaining characterizations of natural compromises between those focal (albeit polar) evaluation functions."}, {"header": "satisfies COMMON, TICHP, PICHT, and TIUP.", "content": "A social planner may view both health effects and productivity effects as important outcomes of interventions and may therefore choose an evaluation function like the pqaly. Health status and productivity of individuals enter the evaluation function multiplicatively. The qaly-pqaly evaluation function divides the evaluation exercise into two separate tasks; namely the valuation of the pure health effects among individuals following an intervention."}, {"header": "Discussion", "content": "The results presented above in the form of evaluation functions and their required axioms may be utilised in empirical applications, for example as part of an economic evaluation of a health care or working environment intervention."}, {"header": "Concluding remarks", "content": "In a health setting, power qaly functional forms are typically associated to a formalization of the so-called \"fair innings\" They rank well-being vectors according to the sum of a strictly increasing (dubbed equivalent health-adjusted lifespan)"}]}
