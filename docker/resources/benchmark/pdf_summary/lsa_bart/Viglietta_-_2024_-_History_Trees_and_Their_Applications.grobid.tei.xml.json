These agents can send each other messages and modify their internal states based on the messages they receive. A common algorithmic approach in this setting involves assigning a \"weight\" to each agent."}, {"header": "Basic Structure and Algorithms", "content": "In this section we focus on anonymous networks operating in synchronous steps, modeled as undirected dynamic multigraphs with no port awareness. The distributed construction of views can be achieved via an iterative process, assuming that all agents send their current view to all their neighbors at every step. This technique achieves optimal running times and matches in efficiency the best algorithms for static networks."}, {"header": "Leader Election", "content": "Can a Counting algorithm terminate in a polynomial number of steps in all strongly connected directed dynamic simple networks with (early or late) outdegree awareness and a unique leader? For networks that are not necessarily connected at all steps, we define a communication round."}]}
