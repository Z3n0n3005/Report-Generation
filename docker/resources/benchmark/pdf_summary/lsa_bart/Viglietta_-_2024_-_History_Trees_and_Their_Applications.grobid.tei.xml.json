      "content": "History trees are a data structure that inherently includes a temporal dimension and was specifically designed for networks with dynamic topologies. The introduction of history trees has recently led to the development of optimal linear-time algorithms for anonymous dynamic networks."

      "content": "In this section we focus on anonymous networks operating in synchronous steps, modeled as undirected dynamic multigraphs with no port awareness. The result is the smallest tree containing v t g (p) and all views in m as induced subtrees."

      "content": "In this case, any agent that becomes distinguishable from all others at time t can be identified with certainty by time t + 2n -2, allowing all agents to terminate. The goal is to design a universal protocol that enables memoryless agents to construct coherent views of some history tree related to the network."
