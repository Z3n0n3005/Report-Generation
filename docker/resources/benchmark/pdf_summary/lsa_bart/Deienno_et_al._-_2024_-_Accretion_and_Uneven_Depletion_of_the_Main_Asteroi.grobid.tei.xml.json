There are currently two different views for explaining the MAB's low mass."}, {"header": "MODEL", "content": "The exact time and radial distance of Jupiter's formation is unknown. We followed the accretion of objects within our MAB region for 5 Myr. All planetesimals within all tracer particles are allowed to have self-gravitational interactions and to collide with one-another."}, {"header": "MAB, DATASET, AND COMPARISON WITH MPC", "content": "The giant planet instability has been found to heavily deplete the MAB. Different MAB sub-regions have different depletion factors. The work by Our analyses clearly demonstrate that MAB depletion during the giantPlanet instability is not uniform."}, {"header": "RESULTS", "content": "The only known S-complex asteroid with D > 500 km is (4) Vesta. Vesta should be considered as an object of possible formation and survival within the IMB. Our low estimate for the primordial MAB mass points to the conclusion there is no longer the need for an early giant planet instability to stunt Mars' growth."}, {"header": "CONCLUSIONS", "content": "The current MAB total mass is tiny. There is a debate in the literature on whether such a small MAB mass was primordial. In this work we followed accretion (growth and fragmentation) of planetesimals in the MAB."}]}
