We conclude with an overview of possible solutions to prevent knowledge collapse in the AI-era."}, {"header": "Related Work", "content": "Technology has long affected how we access knowledge, raising concerns about its impact on the transmission and creation of knowledge. We focus on recent work on the role of digital platforms and social interactions, and mention only in passing the literature on historical innovations and knowledge."}, {"header": "The media, filter bubbles and echo chambers", "content": "In the ideological version of the echo-chamber hypothesis, individuals within a latent ideological space are exposed to peers and content with ideologically-similar views. If so, their beliefs are reinforced socially and by a generalization from their bounded observations, leading to political polarization. The second main line of analysis focuses on \"filter bubbles,\" whereby the content to which users are exposed is selected based on a recommendation system."}, {"header": "Network effects and Information Cascades", "content": "Information cascade models explore the conditions under which private information is not efficiently aggregated by the public. These models suggest specific opinion-formation dynamics based on what other humans, texts, images, etc.an individual interacts with."}, {"header": "Model collapse", "content": "The idea of model collapse is rooted in the earlier phenomenon of \"mode collapse\" in generative adversarial networks.GANs are based on a generator neural network that proposes, e.g.an image, and a discriminator attempts to predict whether a given image is created by the generator or is a real image from the dataset."}, {"header": "Known biases in LLMs", "content": "Newer AI models such as LLMs are not immune to the problems of bias identified and measured in machine learning algorithms. Recent work attempts to address these issues through a variety of methods."}, {"header": "A Model of Knowledge Collapse Defining Knowledge Collapse", "content": "A commonly held, optimistic view is that knowledge has improved monotonically over time, and will continue to do so. This appears to be the case for certain scientific fields like physics, chemistry, or molecular biology. In other domains, however, it is less clear, especially within regions."}, {"header": "Model Overview", "content": "We model knowledge as a process of approximating a (Students t) probability distribution. We assume that individuals cannot foresee the future, but they do observe in common the realized rewards from previous rounds. Individuals' investments in innovation have positive spillovers to the extent they can move public knowledge towards the truth."}, {"header": "Results", "content": "In contrast to the literature on model collapse, we consider the conditions under which strategic humans may seek out the input data that will maintain the full distribution of knowledge. For example, Christian communities at times actively promoted and preserved 'canonical' texts while neglecting or banning others."}, {"header": "Discussion", "content": "We provide a theoretical framework for defining \"knowledge collapse\", whereby dependence on generative AI may lead to a reduction in the long-tails of knowledge. While our work does not justify an outright ban, measures should be put in place to ensure safeguards against widespread or complete reliance on AI models."}, {"header": "Appendix Comparing width of the tails", "content": "We can compare the results with a standard normal distribution (i.e. a t-distribution as the degrees of freedom becomes large) or with wider tails. As mentioned above, the reported results used a tdistribution with 10 degrees offreedom, which has slightly wider tails than a standardnormal distribution."}, {"header": "Defining knowledge collapse", "content": "In the example cited in the main section, the ancient Roman recipe for concrete is part of broad historical knowledge but not part of available current knowledge.Technological innovations from the printing press to the internet to AI mediate human interactions and human's exposure to historical and current sources of knowledge."}]}
