Although we have some knowledge of the cumulative slope of the sfd for kuiper belt objects (e.g.,, not much is known about the sFD of planetesinals that formed in the ma region."}, {"header": "MAB, DATASET, AND COMPARISON WITH MPC", "content": "Figureshows very good agreement between results fromand real data from mpc (compare also the numbers from rows labeled mpc n ast and d18 n f inal ast from table) While accounting for the necessary effects happening during 4.5 gyr after gas disk dispersal as listed in the beginning of this section."}, {"header": "RESULTS", "content": "We can safely use our evolved sfds to apply our depletion rates to determine what initial mab mass (primordial mass that formed at 0.5 myr after cais; section 2) can reproduce the current sfd, number of objects with d > 500 km, and total mass observed in s-complex asteroids. We find that the presence of jupiter leads to the fewer such large objects, especially within the omb and eomb, but within the cmb."}, {"header": "CONCLUSIONS", "content": "There is a debate in the literature on whether such a small mab mass was primordial. In this work we followed accretion (growth and fragmentation) of planetesimals in the mab during the period when gas still existed in the solar nebula."}]}
