      "content": "history trees are a newer data structure that inherently includes a temporal dimension and was specifically designed for networks with dynamic topologies. The introduction of history trees has recently led to the development of optimal linear-time algorithms for anonymous dynamic networks."

      "content": " static anonymous networks are well understood thanks to the works of yamashita-kameda, boldi-vigna, and other authors. The view t g (p) of an agent p in a static network g is an infinite tree rooted at p, where each node of depth k represents a distinct 2."

      "content": "In section 2.3 we gave a counting algorithm for connected undirected dynamic networks with a unique leader that stabilizes in 2n -2 steps. Since the network is connected at all steps, it can be shown that only 2n-2 levels of the history tree are required for this algorithm to eventually identify nodes with correct guesses."
