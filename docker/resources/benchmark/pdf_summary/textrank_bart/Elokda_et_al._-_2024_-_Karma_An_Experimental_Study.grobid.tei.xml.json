Compared with random allocation, karma leads to substantial efficiency gains, and these gains benefit almost all participants."}]}, {"header": "EXPERIMENTAL METHODS", "content": [{"summary_text": "Treatments varied in the dynamic urgency process of the participants and the richness of the karma scheme. For urgency, we distinguished between a low stake process where participants have frequent events with moderate urgency. For richness, we tested a binary scheme where participants can choose from only two bid levels that depend on their karma."}]}, {"header": "RESULTS", "content": [{"summary_text": "In all treatments, more than 90% of the population is better off with karma than under random allocation. The most favorable combination is high stake with binary bidding. Most individuals are on the benefiting side."}]}, {"header": "DISCUSSION", "content": [{"summary_text": "In all treatments, (almost) all participants manage to benefit from the karma scheme in comparison to random allocation, with the exception of the lowest decile of non-adopters who did not actively participate in the bidding. The most favorable treatment combination in our experiments was that of high stake urgency process under binary bidding scheme."}]}]}
