We tested a binary scheme where participants can choose from only two bid levels that depend on their karma, and a full range scheme where they have full choice over bid up to their karma."}, {"header": "RESULTS", "content": "There are positive total efficiency gains in all treatments (median ranging from 7.38% to 15.34%). The efficiency gains are especially pronounced in the upper half of the population. While all treatments outperform random, there are weakly significantly higher gains of the high stake treatments relative to the low stake treatments."}, {"header": "DISCUSSION", "content": "Karma could be capable of achieving higher efficiency gains than realized in our online experiments if the human population consisted of participants that were better trained. The realized gains of online subjects correspond to if players discount future rounds by about 0.3-0.7, while those of experts correspond to a future discount factor of more than 0.98."}]}
