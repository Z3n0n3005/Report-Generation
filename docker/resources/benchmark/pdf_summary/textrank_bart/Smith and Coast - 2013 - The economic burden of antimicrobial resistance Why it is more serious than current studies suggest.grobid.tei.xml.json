      "header": "Introduction",
      "content":  "The ability of organisms to develop resistance to the effects of antimicrobial therapies is potentially the greatest challenge to healthcare in the 21 st century. It increases the threat not only of primary infectious diseases such as tuberculosis, but also secondary infections associated with other diseases and the provision of healthcare. The paper highlights the critical problem with the current emphasis on using economic burden as evidence for directing future investment in health issues."

    {
      "header": "A brief history of AMR",
      "content":  "Resistance may be seen as essentially a reaction to the use of antimicrobial treatments. Over time there is no reason to suspect that resistance will not occur to all antimicrobials."
    },
    {
      "header": "The current situation",
      "content":  "Increase in organisms resistant to multiple therapies is now coinciding with the reduction in new therapies coming to market to replace ineffective ones. That resistance develops to an antimicrobial therapy is not itself a problem -and is merely a natural process."

    {
      "header": "FIGURE 1: DRUG DISCOVERY",
      "content":  "In 2004, only 1.6% of drugs in development by the world's 15 largest drug companies were antimicrobials. At the same time that the number of new therapeutics has been declining, organisms like S.Aureus and E.faecium have been acquiring resistance to multiple therapies."

    {
      "header": "Current activities",
      "content":  "There are various policy, public and professional reports and strategies. Work, such as that in the UK, is enabling us to become better custodians of antibiotics, reshaping the debate on how to control AMR."
    },
    {
      "header": "Why these are not sufficient",
      "content":  "The core problems, of widespread use, rapid transmission and lack of new product development, remain. There are few incentives for pharmaceutical companies to develop a new drug for which health systems will aim to restrict use. For each individual who wants to take an antimicrobial to feel better, the impact on resistance of their specific antimicrobial use is virtually unidentifiable."

    {
      "header": "Evidence on current economic burden",
      "content":  "Treatment failure caused by AMR contributes to increased costs of care. Cost estimates will depend on, for instance, whether assessment is at the level of the individual or (multiple) institutions."

      "header": "Updated literature review",

      "header": "TABLE 1 SUMMARY OF COST DATA",
      "content":  "There are a vast range of figures, from less than \u00a35 to more than \u00a320,000 in reported additional costs per patient per episode. Most studies originate in the USA, which has a unique health system."

      "header": "TABLE 2: COMPARATIVE ECONOMIC BURDEN",

    {
      "header": "Limits of assessing 'costs of resistance'",
      "content":  "A standard 'cost-of-illness' approach will not capture the true nature of the costs of AMR. AMR is a negative externality associated with consumption of antimicrobials."

      "header": "FIGURE 2: SIGMOIDAL DEVELOPMENT OF AMR",
      "content":  "Antimicrobials are the cornerstone of modern medicine that revolutionized healthcare. The 'real' costs of AMR are those that relate to the loss of these benefits. MDR bacteria have increased mortality rates amongst newborn babies."

      "header": "BOX 2: CASE STUDY HIPS",
      "content":  "The health system has changed fundamentally over the last 60 years, with antimicrobials integrated in almost all aspects of care. The system is designed to treat more chronic conditions, provide treatments on a short-term -often day-case -basis."

    {
      "header": "Conclusion",
      "content":  "We are entering a pivotal period where, if current trends continue, there could be highly significant costs to healthcare. As AMR is a natural process, we are not looking at something that can be 'eradicated' Effective antimicrobials need rediscovering as a scarce -and largely nonrenewable -resource."

      "content":  "We know the current economic burden is relatively low compared with other problems. We do not know to what extent the future burden will grow, or how quickly. A key research need is to estimate the impact of widespread resistance."

    {
      "header": "Developing better, more radical, incentive mechanisms",
      "content":  "In terms of the development of new antimicrobials, if new therapies are discovered then they need to be protected. New options are needed that can discourage high levels of use whilst avoiding disincentives for private sector R&D into new therapies."

      "header": "Lessons from climate change",
      "content":  "Both issues are subject to considerable uncertainty about their future extent and trajectory. Both have as an underlying cause the over-consumption of 'goods' that lead to short term benefit."

      "content":  "Infection rates, at 6, are approximately 0.5-2%, so most patients go down route 7. At point 8 rates of post-operative infection are around 40-50%; of these, 30% go on to die -state 21."

      "header": "Search Process",
      "content":  "Given the limited resources, both financially and in terms of time, the searching of databases was limited to Web of Science and Medline. Initial searching of electronic databases utilised key terms taken from the earlier review, searching on combinations of terms related to antimicrobial, resistance and costs."

      "header": "Stage 3: Further electronic bibliographic database searching relating to specific terminology",
      "content":  "Given limited resources, it was not feasible to search on all possible micro-organism names and all potential drugs. Instead, a second search aimed to focus on two of the most studied and potentially more serious current resistant infections: Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus."

      "header": "Inclusion criteria",
      "content":  "Review papers were not selected for inclusion in the review, but where these were identified they were accessed for the purpose of citation tracking. Studies were not accepted or rejected on the basis of any quality criteria. Other economic aspects of the antimicrobial resistance problem, such as the costeffectiveness of alternative control strategies, were not included."

      "header": "Identification of papers",

      "header": "Findings",
      "content":  "It should be emphasised that, because of the lack of resources for a full systematic review, including searching for all combinations of micro-organisms and drugs, the totality of this literature is almost certainly under-estimated. In total, the review identified 24 relevant papers."
