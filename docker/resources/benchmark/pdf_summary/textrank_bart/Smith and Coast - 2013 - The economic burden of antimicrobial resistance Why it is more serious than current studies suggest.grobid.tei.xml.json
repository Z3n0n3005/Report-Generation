It increases the threat not only of primary infectious diseases such as tuberculosis, but also secondary infections associated with healthcare itself."}, {"header": "A brief history of AMR", "content": "Resistance may be seen as essentially a reaction to the use of antimicrobial treatments. Over time there is no reason to suspect that resistance will not occur to all antimicrobials. The only question is to what level."}, {"header": "The current situation", "content": "Increase in organisms resistant to multiple therapies is now coinciding with the reduction in new therapies coming to market to replace ineffective ones. Between 1983 and 1992, 30 new antibiotics were approved in the usa, but only seven have been approved since 2003."}, {"header": "FIGURE 1: DRUG DISCOVERY", "content": "In 2004, only 1.6% of drugs in development by the world's 15 largest drug companies were antimicrobials. Only two new drugs under development, both of which are in the early stages when failure rates are high."}, {"header": "Current activities", "content": "In the uk, the first antimicrobial resistance strategy, published in 2000, had three inter-related key elements -surveillance, prudent antimicrobial prescribing and infection control. These aspects are still relevant today. Work is enabling us to become better custodians of antibiotics."}, {"header": "Why these are not sufficient", "content": "There are few incentives for pharmaceutical companies to develop a new drug for which health systems will aim to restrict use. The impact on resistance of specific antimicrobial use is virtually unidentifiable, making it hard to enforce a substantive reduction in use."}, {"header": "Evidence on current economic burden", "content": "Treatment failure contributes to increased costs of care associated with: additional investigations such as laboratory tests and x-ray examinations. Additional or alternative treatments, often much more expensive than drugs used to treat infections caused by sensitive organisms. Additional sideeffects from more toxic treatments, which have to be managed; longer hospital stay; longer time off work."}, {"header": "Updated literature review", "content": "Review focused both on costs of amr and the costeffectiveness of control strategies. Found a total of 43 studies, although 22 were categorised at high risk of bias and excluded from analysis."}, {"header": "TABLE 1 SUMMARY OF COST DATA", "content": "There is a low, selective and widely divergent evidence base concerning 'the economic burden of amr' There is a heavy predominance of hospital-based studies, and indeed the costs are almost exclusively related to costs of additional hospitalization/treatment."}, {"header": "The case of MRSA", "content": "There is a very wide range of costs. Even at the high-end, the costs remain quite modest. Unlike some of the resistant gram-negatives currently emerging, there remains a choice of therapy available to treat mrsa."}, {"header": "BOX 1: A CASE STUDY OF MRSA", "content": "The relatively low cost for mrsa is reflective of amr more generally, as illustrated in table. Table provides estimates for various disease areas, standardized to 2004 us$bn, compared with the current highest estimate found for the societal cost ofAmr to the usa in 2011."}, {"header": "TABLE 2: COMPARATIVE ECONOMIC BURDEN", "content": "Amr is acknowledged to be a significant threat to health and healthcare. Current estimates of the cost of amr are based loosely on the 'incremental' cost related to the extra treatment of resistant over susceptible infection. These costs, broadly speaking, increase as we see multi-drug resistance emerge."}, {"header": "Limits of assessing 'costs of resistance'", "content": "Amr is a negative externality associated with consumption of antimicrobials. It has an undesirable effect which is distant from the current consumption decision. Even if it were possible to increase the cost of consumption (e.g. price of antimicrobial, or cost of prescription), it would only be extremely minor for each individual decision."}, {"header": "FIGURE 2: SIGMOIDAL DEVELOPMENT OF AMR", "content": "antimicrobials are the cornerstone of modern medicine that revolutionized healthcare during the last half-century. Estimates of cost-of-illness tend not to focus on less direct costs associated with the impact of resistance on patient safety."}, {"header": "BOX 2: CASE STUDY HIPS", "content": " antimicrobials are given as a matter of standard prophylactic care. Removing them could mean soaring rates of post-operative infection, mortality and morbidity. This would also have enormous wider economic impacts (significant workforce impacts)"}, {"header": "Conclusion", "content": "Antimicrobials need to be rediscovered as a scarce -and largely nonrenewable -resource. We need to balance the positive effects of using antimicrobial therapies now, and the negative impact of this use on their temporal effectiveness."}, {"header": "Reducing uncertainty and increasing knowledge of full health system impacts", "content": "We know the current economic burden is relatively low compared with other problems. Yet we do not know to what extent the future burden will grow. We are therefore faced with considerable uncertainty."}, {"header": "Developing better, more radical, incentive mechanisms", "content": "There needs to be an improvement in the incentive mechanisms at a number of levels. If new therapies are discovered then they need to be protected, and hence the use of them discouraged. Radical strategies should be considered, such as moving to more restrictive prescription."}, {"header": "Enhancing international activity", "content": "International activity may be key to encouraging the development of new drugs and diagnostics to help control multi resistant bacteria. It may also be vital to research to increase understanding of resistance mechanisms, cost trajectories, and means of controlling resistance."}, {"header": "Lessons from climate change", "content": "For both antimicrobial resistance and climate change there is considerable inertia to the major, radical, change required to move from mitigation to prevention. Yet there do appear to be some differences, however. There appears to be increasing scientific consensus about the impact of global warming in a way that is perhaps less clear -or at least coherent - for antimicrobial Resistance."}, {"header": "BOX 2: CASE STUDY HIPS", "content": "Antimicrobial therapies are, and have been, part of routine care ever since hip replacements became available. We looked at information relating to amputation as a proxy for what rates may have been pre-and post-antimicrobial discovery. At point 8 rates of post-operative infection are around 40-50%; of these, 30% go on to die."}, {"header": "Search Process", "content": "given the limited resources, both financially and in terms of time, the searching of databases was limited to web of science and medline and to searches on titles. Specific terms included were: antimicrobial, resistance and costs."}, {"header": "Stage 2/4: Citation searching", "content": "review papers identified through the review were also used in citation searching, both at this stage and following stage 3 searching. reference lists of papers selected for thereview were scanned to identify any further papers."}, {"header": "Stage 3: Further electronic bibliographic database searching relating to specific terminology", "content": "The study looked at papers relating to evidence about the costs of resistance in relation to particular micro-organisms. Given limited resources, it was not feasible to search on all possible micro-organism names and all potential drugs. Instead, a second search aimed to focus on two of the most studied and potentially more serious current resistant infections."}, {"header": "Inclusion criteria", "content": "review papers were not selected for inclusion in the review, but where these were identified they were accessed for the purpose of citation tracking. Studies were not accepted or rejected on the basis of any quality criteria. Other economic aspects of the antimicrobial resistance problem, such as the costeffectiveness of alternative control strategies, were not included."}, {"header": "Identification of papers", "content": " papers in the stage 1 search were initially identified from abstracts obtained in the literature search and screened by three individuals. Papers that were obtained were then read and a final decision made on whether they should be included in the review."}, {"header": "Data extraction", "content": "standardised data extraction forms, based on the earlier systematic review, were utilised. The following data were extracted for each study:. The data was extracted using the following forms:"}, {"header": "Findings", "content": "In total, the review identified 24 relevant papers. Because of the lack of resources for a full systematic review, the totality of this literature is almost certainly under-estimated. In terms of general estimates of the overall burden of resistance, relevant studies should have been captured during the stage 1 search."}]}
