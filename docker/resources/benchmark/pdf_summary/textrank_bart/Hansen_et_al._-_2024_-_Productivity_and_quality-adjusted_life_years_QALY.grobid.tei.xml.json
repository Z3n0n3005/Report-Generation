For each pair i, j \u2208 N with a i = a j = a and t i = t j = t, and each c > 0, 2. For a pair of individuals at common health and time, it does not matter who gains in productivity."

Health status and productivity of individuals enter the evaluation function multiplicatively. The QALY-PQALY evaluation function measures the relative importance that the social planner puts on pure health effects."
