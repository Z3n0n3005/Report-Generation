We focus on recent work on the role of digital platforms and social interactions .We consider game theoretic models of information cascades as an alternative model for failure in social learning ."}, {"header": "The media, filter bubbles and echo chambers", "content": "In the ideological version of the echo-chamber hypothesis, individuals within a latent ideological space are exposed to peers and content with ideologically-similar views .If so, their beliefs are reinforced socially and by a generalization from their bounded observations, leading to political polarization ."}, {"header": "Network effects and Information Cascades", "content": "Information cascade models provide one approach to explaining a kind of herd behavior .They explore the conditions under which private information is not efficiently aggregated by the public .This can occur where individuals sequentially make decisions from a discrete set ."}, {"header": "Model collapse", "content": "GANs are based on a generator neural network that proposes, e.g.an image, and a discriminator attempts to predict whether a given image is created by the generator . In practice they may settle into producing a narrow range of images for which it is good at fooling the discriminator ."}, {"header": "Known biases in LLMs", "content": "Newer AI models such as LLMs are not immune to the problems of bias identified and measured in machine learning algorithms Recent work attempts to address these issues through a variety of methods .

We assume that individuals cannot foresee the future, but they observe in common the realized rewards from previous rounds .Depending on how their utility is calculated, these could be interpreted as different expected returns from innovation (e.g.technooptimists versus pessimists), or their relative ability or desire to engage in innovation ."}, {"header": "Results", "content": ".
