lead to \"knowledge collapse\" we provide a positive knowledge spillovers model with in which individuals decide whether to invest in samples from the full distribution of true knowledge ."},

one approach to explaining a kind of herd behavior . they explore the conditions under which private information is not efficiently aggregated by the public . this can generate a \"herd externality\" in which an individual ignores her private signal in deciding ."}, {"header": "Model collapse", "content": "dea of model collapse is rooted in the earlier phenomenon of \"mode collapse\" in generative

beliefs that were once held by communities of humans ."}, {"header": "Model Overview", "content": "key dynamic of the model is to allow for the possibility that rational agents may be able to prevent or correct for distortion from over-dependence on 'centrist' information . if past samples neglect the 'tail' regions, the returns from such knowledge should be relatively higher . individuals would be willing to pay more (put in more labor) to profit from these additional gains ."}, {"header": "Results", "content": "present the kernel density estimate of public knowledge at the end of 100 rounds

such harm can be mitigated to the extent that we are aware of the potential value of niche, specialized and eccentric perspectives that may be neglected by ai-generated data .for every hundred people

recipe for concrete is part of broad historical knowledge but not part of available current knowledge .this we call 'human memory knowledge' by reference to human working memory ."}]}
