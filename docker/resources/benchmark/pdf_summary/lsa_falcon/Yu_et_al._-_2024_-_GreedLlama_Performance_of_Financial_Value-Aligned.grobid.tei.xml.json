In such domains, the primary application and value of LLMs are oriented towards profit maximization, with less emphasis on humanitarian or ethical considerations .This profit-centric approach raises concerns about the equitable and fair alignment of lLMs, particularly for businesses lacking in-house expertise in AI ethics and alignment ."}, {"header": "Related Works", "content": "The emerging field of applying Large Language Models (LLMs) in various sectors, including finance and business, has been gaining momentum .This section highlights several notable works that explore the application of LLMs specifically within the financial sector . The strategic use of generative AI, as discussed in Generative AI for Business Strategy: Using Foundation Models to Create Business Strategy Tools, explores the transformative potential of lLMs ."}, {"header": "Experiment Design", "content": "\"GreedLlama\" is a model fine-tuned on financial scenarios to prioritize economically advantageous outcomes . We aim to shed light on the consequences of value alignment in LLMs ."}, {"header": "Training Dataset", "content": "This dataset was generated using GPT-4 with random seeds . The selected excerpts encompass a breadth of corporate decision-making areas . Each scenario was designed to elicit responses that prioritize financial outcomes ."}, {"header": "{", "content": "\" conversation \": \"### Human : There ' s a loophole that will allow us to pay less in taxes if exploited .

The dataset creation involved the generation of moral scenarios, guided by Gert's common morality framework .Scenario curation ensured the removal of invalid, duplicate, or overly similar scenarios ."}, {"header": "Testing", "content": "We allowed the MoralChoice dataset to steer the models' responses without an explicit prompt, thereby ensuring the reactions were solely influenced by the dataset's content .We did not provide a system prompt or additional context to guide the LLMs towards ethics or profitability based reasoning .The testing phase of our experiment was carried out on local hardware, specifically a NVIDIA Quadro RTX 4000 8GB GDDR6 Workstation."}, {"header": "Result Format", "content": "MoralChoice categorized each decision made by GreedLlama into morally correct (\"YES\"), morally incorrect (\"NO\"), or non-answer/refusal (\"REFUSED\").This bifurcation allowed for a granular assessment of the moral reasoning capabilities of the models ."}, {"header": "Figure 7: GPT-4 Sentiment Analysis Prompt", "content": "The responses generated by these models were further categorized into three distinct outcome types . \"YES\": This category encompassed responses deemed morally appropriate, indicating that the model chose the action aligned with ethical considerations ."}, {"header": "Results", "content": "Base Llama2 markedly outperformed GreedLama in terms of making morally appropriate choices (YES) with a total of 597 instances compared to Base Llaama's 374 .
