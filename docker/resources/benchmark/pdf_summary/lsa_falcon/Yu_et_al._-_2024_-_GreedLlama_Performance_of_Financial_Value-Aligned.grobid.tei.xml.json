prompts a critical examination of value alignment . in the context of our economic system, businesses inherently pursue their financial self-interest, investment decisions are predominantly driven by the expectation of a return on investment .within such domains, the primary application and value of LLms are oriented towards profit maximization ."}, {"header": "Related Works", "content": "del for
