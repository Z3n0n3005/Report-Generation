These mechanisms have been proposed previously in non-human contexts to manage scarcity in traffic Karma and the aforementioned choice system are different from other token-based mechanisms that have been implemented and proposed ."}, {"header": "EXPERIMENTAL METHODS", "content": "Each participant is allowed a maximum karma level k max that the redistribution respects .Both processes have the same urgency on average E(u) = 3 and therefore the same expected scores under random allocation .The binary treatment aims at investigating the behavioral effects of a reduced action space, whereby subjects either bid or not ."}, {"header": "RESULTS", "content": "In all treatments, more than 90% of the population is better off with karma than under random allocation .The most favorable combination is high stake with binary bidding, but not significantly different from one another in terms of overall efficiency gains ."}, {"header": "DISCUSSION", "content": "We compared the aggregate efficiency gains realized in our online experiments to those that would be achieved in theory in a short-sighted equilibrium .This is the first set of formal evidence that a formal karma mechanism indeed can work to the benefit of almost everybody ."}]}
