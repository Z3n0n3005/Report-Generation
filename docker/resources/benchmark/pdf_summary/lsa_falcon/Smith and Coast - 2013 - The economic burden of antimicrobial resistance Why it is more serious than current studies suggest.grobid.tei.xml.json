present and that which may be predicted for the future ."}, {"header": "A brief history of AMR", "content": "bial therapies can accelerate this natural process, whereby sensitive micro-organisms are soon eliminated by resistant ones (4) . there are uncertainties over the development of resistance, the 'genetic cost' to the organism, and the extent to which resistance is temporary or permanent, there is concern that over time there is no reason to suspect that resistance will not occur ."}, {"header": "The current situation", "content": "ple therapies is coinciding with the reduction in new therapies coming to market to replace ineffective ones . that resistance develops to an antimicrobial therapy is not itself a problem - and as indicated is merely a natural process, albeit accelerated by use of these therapies .between 1983 and 1992, 30 new antibiotics were approved in the usa, but only seven have been approved since 2003 ."}, {"header": "FIGURE 1: DRUG DISCOVERY", "content": "2004, only 1.6% of drugs in development by the world's 15 largest drug companies were antimicrobials . the number of new therapeutics has been declining, organisms such as s. aureus and e. faecium have been acquiring resistance to multiple therapies .the rapid spread of any such organism is a clear cause for concern ."}, {"header": "Current activities", "content": "k, the first antimicrobial resistance strategy, published in 2000, had three inter-related key elements -surveillance, prudent antibiotic prescribing and infection control .work is enabling us to become better custodians of antibiotics, reshaping the debate on how to control amr .this has involved encouraging better diagnosis, medicine management and use of therapeutics by promoting the prudent use of antibacterials and educating healthcare workers to use antibiotics more appropriately ."}, {"header": "Why these are not sufficient", "content": "In this respect, incentives continue to be the major concern at all levels .there has been an almost total shutdown in new product development . there are few incentives for pharmaceutical companies to develop a new drug for which health systems will aim to restrict use ."}, {"header": "Evidence on current economic burden", "content": "problem is that, far from illuminating the burden of resistance, this translates into a vast range of figures depending upon what precisely is assessed .cost estimates will depend on, for example, whether assessment is at the level of the individual or (multiple) institutions, whether figures are based on comparison of a resistant versus susceptible patient/infection ."}, {"header": "Updated literature review", "content": "view focused both on costs of amr and the costeffectiveness of control strategies . it found a

SUMMARY OF COST DATA", "content": "dies listed in table 1 are consistent with previous reviews, indicating three key findings that appear robust to change over time . first, there are a vast range of figures, from less than \u00a35 to more than \u00a320,000 in reported additional costs per patient per episode for hospital costs and anything up to around \u00a310 billion per year for full societal costs . most studies originate in the usa, but such a degree of national dominance is still unusual ."}, {"header": "The case of MRSA", "content": "versus mssa is a very wide range of costs . second,

the league table of disease burden for the us ."}, {"header": "TABLE 2: COMPARATIVE ECONOMIC BURDEN", "content": "based loosely on the 'incremental' cost related to the extra treatment of resistant over (actual or assumed) susceptible infection . these costs, broadly speaking, increase as we see multi-drug resistance emerge (such as in case of mdr-tb), but at present organisms that are mr remain relatively rare and often occur in isolated outbreaks ."}, {"header": "Limits of assessing 'costs of resistance'", "content": "dard 'cost-of-illness' approach will not capture the true nature of the costs of amr for three reasons . first, consumption of an antimicrobial will contribute to organisms generating resistance to its effects . that is, it has an undesirable effect which is distant from the current consumption decision ."}, {"header": "FIGURE 2: SIGMOIDAL DEVELOPMENT OF AMR", "content": "-of-illness tend not to focus on less direct costs associated with the impact of resistance on

said that amr presents a risk that we will fall back into the pre-antibiotic era (3). however, this is perhaps a more rosy picture than the reality . the system is designed to treat more chronic
