It increases the threat of primary infectious diseases such as tuberculosis, but also secondary infections associated both with other diseases and the provision of healthcare itself .The paper highlights the critical problem with the current emphasis on using economic burden as evidence for directing future investment in health issues ."}, {"header": "A brief history of AMR", "content": "Resistance may be seen as essentially a reaction to the use of antimicrobial therapies .Although the process of natural selection encourages micro-organisms to adapt to environmental pressures .The use of antibiotic therapies can accelerate this natural process .Believe the development of resistance, the 'genetic cost' to the organism ."}, {"header": "The current situation", "content": "Why is the level of concern increasing now? It is because the increase in organisms resistant to multiple therapies coinciding with the reduction in new therapies coming to market to replace ineffective ones . That resistance develops to an antimicrobial therapy is not itself a problem - and as indicated is merely a natural process, albeit accelerated by use of these therapies ."}, {"header": "FIGURE 1: DRUG DISCOVERY", "content": "In 2004, only 1.6% of drugs in development by the world's 15 largest drug companies were antimicrobials . In the same time that the number of new therapeutics has been declining, organisms such as S. Aureus and E. faecium have been acquiring resistance to multiple therapies .We are therefore at a pivotal stage in the history of infectious disease ."}, {"header": "Current activities", "content": "Work is enabling us to become better custodians of antibiotics, reshaping the debate on how to control AMR .This has involved encouraging better diagnosis, medicine management and use of therapeutics by promoting the prudent use of antimicrobials and educating healthcare workers to use antibiotics more appropriately ."}, {"header": "Why these are not sufficient", "content": "In this respect, incentives continue to be the major concern at all levels .There is growing emphasis on evidence-based policy making, which includes considering the economic burden of disease, and the demonstrated cost-effectiveness of therapies .It is difficult to enforce a substantive reduction in use, even in areas deemed 'inappropriate'"}, {"header": "Evidence on current economic burden", "content": "quantitatively, the problem is that, far from illuminating the burden of resistance, this translates into a vast range of figures depending upon what precisely is assessed . quantitatively we know that treatment failure caused by AMR contributes to increased costs of care associated with: additional investigations such as laboratory tests and X-ray examinations; additional sideeffects from more toxic treatments, which have to be managed ."}, {"header": "Updated literature review", "content": "The focus of this updating review was the economic burden of resistance; it excluded review of the literature on the costeffectiveness of alternative control strategies .Initial searches were only conducted on combinations of resistant/ce, antimicrob/ial and cost/s; as it became clear that papers that did not refer to antimicrobial resistance more generally would not be captured in this search ."}, {"header": "TABLE 1 SUMMARY OF COST DATA", "content": ". There are a vast range of figures, from less than \u00a35 to more than \u00a320,000 in reported additional costs per patient per episode for hospital costs and anything up to around \u00a310 billion per year for full societal costs . Most studies originate in the USA ."}, {"header": "The case of MRSA", "content": "An interesting case study here is clearly that of MRSA versus MSSA . This is summarized in Box 1 and two conclusions are apparent . First, there is a very wide range of costs ."}, {"header": "BOX 1: A CASE STUDY OF MRSA", "content": "The relatively low cost for MRSA is reflective of AMR more generally ."}, {"header": "TABLE 2: COMPARATIVE ECONOMIC BURDEN", "content": "The paradox of the relatively low level of economic impact Current evidence therefore suggests that the economic burden from AMR is actually quite modest .This apparent inconsistency might arise because current estimates of the cost of AMR are based loosely on the 'incremental' cost related to the extra treatment of resistant over (actual or assumed) susceptible infection .These costs, broadly speaking, increase as we see multi-drug resistance emerge (such as in case of MDR-TB)"}, {"header": "Limits of assessing 'costs of resistance'", "content": "AMR is a negative externality associated with consumption of antimicrobials . A standard 'cost-of-illness' approach will not capture the true nature of the costs of AMR ."}, {"header": "FIGURE 2: SIGMOIDAL DEVELOPMENT OF AMR", "content": ". The critical implication is that this uncertainty regarding current and future burden combined with discounting of future benefits means that strategies to reduce transmission are far more likely to appear cost-effective than strategies to control emergence ."}, {"header": "BOX 2: CASE STUDY HIPS", "content": "The 'true' cost of AMR It has been said that AMR presents a risk that we will fall back into the pre-antibiotic era (3).The system is designed to treat more chronic conditions, provide treatments on a short-term -often day-case -basis, and encourage prevention .The full economic burden of this is not only inestimable at present, but unimaginable ."}, {"header": "Conclusion", "content": "We are entering a pivotal period where, if current trends continue, there could be highly significant costs to healthcare, and society more generally, as antimicrobials that form the basis of modern healthcare become increasingly ineffective .As AMR is a natural process, we are not looking at something that can be 'eradicated'; rather, it is something we have to manage if we are to continue to benefit ."}, {"header": "Reducing uncertainty and increasing knowledge of full health system impacts", "content": "We know the current economic burden is relatively low compared with other problems . We do not know to what extent the future burden will grow, or how quickly .We also do not understand whether an increasing burden will give impetus to new technological change outside the drug arena that might mitigate effects ."}, {"header": "Developing better, more radical, incentive mechanisms", "content": "In terms of the development of new antimicrobials, if new therapies are discovered then they need to be protected, and hence the use of them discouraged .New options are needed that discourage high levels of use whilst avoiding disincentives for private sector R&D into new therapies, such as greater publicprivate partnering ."}, {"header": "Enhancing international activity", "content": ".It may be vital to research to increase understanding of resistance mechanisms, cost trajectories, and means of controlling resistance in the absence of new drug developments .There is appreciation of this issue in the UK, where a multi-pronged integrated UK strategy is under development ."}, {"header": "Lessons from climate change", "content": "MRSA adds around $20,000 per patient per episode to the cost of hospital treatment in the USA . For both antimicrobial resistance and climate change there is considerable inertia to the major, radical, change required to move from mitigation to prevention, because there is a focus on current burden and because the personal incentives seldom match those of society more generally ."}, {"header": "BOX 2: CASE STUDY HIPS", "content": "In an attempt to think laterally, we therefore looked at information relating to amputation - another major surgery involving limbs - as a proxy for what rates may have been pre-and post-antimicrobial discovery .We used this information, together with current studies looking at the infection pathway for hip replacement, to construct and suggest possible values for the flow of patients requiring hip replacement .Currently, prophylaxis is standard practice so approximately 100% of patients follow route 4 rather than 5.Most of those"}, {"header": "Search Process", "content": "Electronic bibliographic database searching on generic terminology Initial search of electronic databases utilised key terms taken from the earlier review, searching on combinations of terms related to antimicrobial, resistance and costs.Specific terms included: Web of Science and Medline and titles."}, {"header": "Stage 2/4: Citation searching", "content": "Reference lists of papers selected for review were scanned to identify any further papers .Review papers identified through the review were also used in citation searching ."}, {"header": "Stage 3: Further electronic bibliographic database searching relating to specific terminology", "content": "pirical papers identified in Search 1 and key review papers indicated that there were clearly papers relating to evidence about the costs of resistance in relation to particular micro-organisms that were being missed because of the lack of specific terminology .Again, given limited resources, it was not feasible to search on all possible micro-organismeism names and all potential drugs .
