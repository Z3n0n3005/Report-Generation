The purpose of this paper is to develop a unified framework for the measurement and valuation of outcomes of such programmes and policies .An alternative to QALYs is the so-called productivity-adjusted life years (in short, PALYs), which are calculated by multiplying a productivity index by years lived .The productivity index ranges from 0(completely unproductive) to 1 (completely productive), and may take into consideration factors such as absence"}, {"header": "Preliminaries", "content": "In this section, we present a set of seven axioms that forms the necessary conditions for the theorems presented in the remaining sections of this paper .A possible interpretation could be a situation where a social planner decides to evaluate and prioritise among interventions using the QALY evaluation function .We will return to this example later in the text several times to illustrate how these hypothetical distributions can be evaluated ."}, {"header": "Compromising between QALYs and PALYs", "content": "The purpose of this section is to dismiss those axioms, while obtaining characterizations of natural compromises between those focal (albeit polar) evaluation functions . For example, the productivity-and-quality-adjusted life years evaluation function evaluates distributions by means of the weighted (through productivity and health levels) aggregate time span the distribution yields ."}, {"header": "satisfies COMMON, TICHP, PICHT, and TIUP.", "content": "Theorem 5 implies that one of the values applied by the social planner in this situation is that increases in lifetime among unproductive individuals following an intervention will not increase the desirability of that intervention .The second value specifies that if an intervention leads to extra life years, it does not matter which particular individual (among individuals with the same level of health and productivity) is able to perform better in the workplace (axiom PICHT).The previous family of evaluation functions (6) includes a natural sub-family of"}, {"header": "Discussion", "content": "The data collection of the economic evaluation will typically involve capturing information on all individuals in the intervention and control group regarding their costs, health status and productivity level during the follow-up period of the study .Instead of making that choice directly based on their functional forms, we rather believe the choice should be guided by the axioms they satisfy . In particular, each respondent would be asked to identify the number of individuals x in Intervention B to be indifferent between both interventions ."}, {"header": "Concluding remarks", "content": "In the present framework considering health states, productivity and life years, we could also impose a power transformation of the individual components in each of the structured evaluation functions (1)-( have no effects on (labour market) productivity .To wit, we made no assumptions regarding the domain of health states A (except for the existence of a maximal element)"}]}
