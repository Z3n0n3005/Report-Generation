These networks generally operate in synchronous or asynchronous communication steps .A common algorithmic approach involves assigning a \"weight\" to each agent .This process is analyzed using standard stochastic methods to understand how these weights eventually converge to a common value ."}, {"header": "Basic Structure and Algorithms", "content": "The reader may find it beneficial to examine the software available at https://github.com/viglietta/Dynamic-Networks.The distributed construction of views can be achieved via an iterative process, assuming that all agents send their current view to all their neighbors at every step .Such a subgraph is a directed acyclic graph isomorphic to the so-called folded view T k G (p).Although t = 2n -1 might not be an optimal"}, {"header": "Leader Election", "content": "We present a terminating Counting algorithm for directed networks with late outdegree awareness and a known number l  1 of leaders .It is sufficient for each agent to accumulate incoming messages at every step, updating its view only once every  steps .We find it fitting to conclude this note with an open problem that is unlikely to have a solution using history trees ."}]}
