      "header": "Introduction",
      "content": "The paper aims to develop a unified framework for evaluating health care interventions and occupational health policies by introducing axiomatic foundations for outcome measures. It contrasts Quality-Adjusted Life Years (QALYs) and Productivity-Adjusted Life Years (PALYs), proposing hybrids like Productivity-and-Quality-Adjusted Life Years (PQALYs) to encompass both health-related quality of life and productivity impacts, addressing the complex relationship between health and productivity in societal evaluations."

    {
      "header": "Preliminaries",
      "content": "The paper introduces a framework for evaluating population health profiles based on triples (a_i, p_i, t_i) where each individual i is characterized by a health state a_i, productivity level p_i, and lifetime t_i. It explores various evaluation functions, including QALYs and PALYs, which integrate health, productivity, and time attributes to assess societal preferences and priorities in health care and occupational health interventions."
    },
    {
      "header": "Compromising between QALYs and PALYs",
      "content": "The section aims to develop evaluation functions that compromise between health and productivity dimensions, unlike previous functions relying on strict independence axioms, introducing the productivity-and-quality-adjusted life years (PQALY) evaluation function, which weights health states and productivity levels multiplicatively to assess distributions of individual profiles comprehensively."
    },
    {
      "header": "satisfies COMMON, TICHP, PICHT, and TIUP.",
      "content": "The section explores evaluation functions like PQALY and QALY-PQALY, emphasizing the importance of health and productivity outcomes in interventions. These functions adjust lifespans multiplicatively by health states and productivity levels, rejecting the axiom that improvements in lifetime among unproductive individuals do not increase intervention desirability, while maintaining invariance axioms regarding the interchangeability of life years and productivity improvements among individuals with similar health and productivity levels."
    },
    {
      "header": "Discussion",
      "content": "The presented evaluation functions and their underlying axioms can be applied empirically in economic evaluations of interventions, where data collection involves costs, health status, and productivity levels of individuals. The choice of evaluation function significantly impacts the ranking of distributions, guiding analysts to select functions based on axioms deemed acceptable to society, such as time independence for unproductive individuals (TIUP) or time invariance at common health and productivity (TICHP), with parameters like relative importance of health and productivity improvements (Ïƒ) and health state quality weights (q(a i )) being estimated from data or elicited through methods like person trade-off techniques."
    },
    {
      "header": "Concluding remarks",
      "content": "Some of the models, particularly those with more general functional forms, encompass a broad range of ethical and social concerns, while structured evaluation functions involve a time-linear component where doubling one's time, holding productivity level and health state constant, results in a proportional doubling of their contribution to social welfare, reflecting the foundational principle in QALY and PALY studies."
