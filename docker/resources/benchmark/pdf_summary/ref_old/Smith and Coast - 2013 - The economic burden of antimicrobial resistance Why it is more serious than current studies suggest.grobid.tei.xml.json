    {
      "header": "Introduction",
      "content": "The rise of antimicrobial resistance poses a significant threat to 21st-century healthcare by undermining the efficacy of treatments for both primary and secondary infections, which are critical to many modern medical advancements, and this paper examines the current and future economic burdens of this resistance, emphasizing the challenges in estimating these costs and the policy implications."
    },
    {
      "header": "A brief history of AMR",
      "content": "Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) arises as microorganisms adapt to antimicrobial treatments, with the use of these therapies accelerating natural selection toward resistant strains, posing uncertainties about resistance development, genetic costs, and permanence, highlighting that once an antimicrobial loses effectiveness against resistant strains, it may be permanently compromised."
    },
    {
      "header": "The current situation",
      "content": "The increasing level of concern about antimicrobial resistance stems from the concurrent rise in multi-drug-resistant organisms alongside a decline in new antimicrobial therapies entering the market, threatening to exhaust the available options once resistance develops."
    },
    {
      "header": "FIGURE 1: DRUG DISCOVERY",
      "content": "The declining development of new antimicrobials, coupled with the rise of multi-drug-resistant organisms like MDR-TB and TDR infections, signifies a critical juncture where existing antimicrobial effectiveness is threatened amidst diminishing therapeutic options, posing a significant global health challenge."
    },
    {
      "header": "Current activities",
      "content": "Progress has been made in recent years through policies promoting conservative antimicrobial use, including surveillance, prudent prescribing, and infection control measures, which have enhanced stewardship efforts and are expected to mitigate antimicrobial resistance."
    },
    {
      "header": "Why these are not sufficient",
      "content": "Despite positive changes and increased awareness within the scientific community, interventions aimed at reducing antimicrobial use may still be considered marginal relative to the scale of the problem, with limited impact on preventing the inevitable loss of effective therapies due to widespread use, rapid transmission, and insufficient new product development, exacerbated by existing incentive structures that prioritize short-term profitability over long-term public health concerns."
    },
    {
      "header": "Evidence on current economic burden",
      "content": "Qualitatively, the economic burden of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) includes increased costs associated with treatment failures such as additional investigations, more expensive alternative treatments, managing side effects, longer hospital stays, reduced productivity, and greater mortality risk, among other factors, yet quantitatively, estimating this burden varies widely depending on factors like study scope, perspective (individual vs. societal), disease focus, and methodological approach, complicating accurate assessment of the true economic impact of AMR."
    },
    {
      "header": "Updated literature review",
      "content": "We conducted a systematic literature review focusing on studies published since 2000 that examined the economic impact of antimicrobial resistance (AMR), updating previous research that mostly indicated resource impacts rather than specific monetary values, with findings showing wide variances in reported costs, generally below £100,000 per annum per institution."
    },
    {
      "header": "TABLE 1 SUMMARY OF COST DATA",
      "content": "The studies in Table 1 consistently highlight three enduring findings: wide-ranging reported additional costs per patient per episode for hospital costs, up to around £10 billion annually for societal costs depending on how productivity losses are included; a predominant focus on US-based studies, indicating a limited generalizability to other healthcare systems like the UK; and a heavy emphasis on hospital-based settings, potentially underestimating the economic impact by not including costs associated with early mortality or community settings, indicating gaps and divergences in the evidence base on the economic burden of AMR."
    },
    {
      "header": "The case of MRSA",
      "content": "The case study comparing MRSA to MSSA illustrates a wide range of costs, yet even at the high end, the expenses remain relatively modest; notably, unlike emerging resistant gram-negatives, there are still therapeutic options available for treating MRSA."
    },
    {
      "header": "BOX 1: A CASE STUDY OF MRSA",
      "content": "The relatively low cost for MRSA reflects the broader economic impact of antimicrobial resistance (AMR), as shown in the table, which compares various disease areas and highlights that AMR, with an estimated societal cost of approximately $55 billion per year in the USA, ranks relatively low in terms of overall disease burden."
    },
    {
      "header": "TABLE 2: COMPARATIVE ECONOMIC BURDEN",
      "content": "The paradox of the relatively low economic impact of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) suggests that while current estimates focus on incremental treatment costs for resistant infections, which are modest due to the rarity of highly resistant organisms like extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB), the potential future burden could escalate dramatically with increased transmission and untreatable secondary infections, severely compromising routine healthcare procedures."
    },
    {
      "header": "Limits of assessing 'costs of resistance'",
      "content": "A standard 'cost-of-illness' approach inadequately captures the true costs of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) due to its nature as a negative externality associated with antimicrobial consumption, where the future impacts, though significant, are discounted and thus undervalued in current economic assessments, compounded by the sigmoidal pattern of resistance development which exhibits low costs during early prevention stages but escalates rapidly once resistance becomes prevalent."
    },
    {
      "header": "FIGURE 2: SIGMOIDAL DEVELOPMENT OF AMR",
      "content": "The critical implication is that strategies focusing on reducing transmission of antimicrobial resistance are perceived as more cost-effective than those targeting the emergence of resistance, reinforcing the current status quo; additionally, estimates of the cost of illness often overlook indirect costs related to patient safety and public confidence in healthcare institutions, while the true economic burden of AMR should encompass the loss of benefits derived from antimicrobial therapies across all stages of life, which remains largely unquantified."
    },
    {
      "header": "BOX 2: CASE STUDY HIPS",
      "content": "The true cost of AMR lies beyond the risk of reverting to a pre-antibiotic era, encompassing fundamental changes in healthcare systems heavily reliant on antimicrobials for routine and critical care, potentially leading to catastrophic impacts on health outcomes, healthcare costs, and broader economic stability, necessitating urgent and rigorous investigation into its future consequences."
    },
    {
      "header": "Conclusion",
      "content": "We face a critical juncture where escalating costs to healthcare and society are imminent due to increasing antimicrobial resistance, necessitating the management rather than eradication of this natural process to preserve the effectiveness of antimicrobial therapies as a scarce and non-renewable resource, posing challenges in balancing present benefits with future stewardship akin to issues like global warming."
    },
    {
      "header": "Reducing uncertainty and increasing knowledge of full health system impacts",
      "content": "The current economic burden of antimicrobial resistance is relatively low compared to other issues, but uncertainty about future burdens and the potential for technological advancements outside the drug arena to mitigate effects pose significant challenges, necessitating investment now in reduced antimicrobial use to potentially avert higher future costs, highlighting the need for improved research to estimate impacts across healthcare and broader society."
    },
    {
      "header": "Developing better, more radical, incentive mechanisms",
      "content": "Improving incentive mechanisms across multiple levels is essential: for developing new antimicrobials, there's a need to protect discoveries while discouraging their excessive use through strategies like public-private partnerships, pre-purchase agreements, or increased public funding; for individuals, balancing minimal personal costs with societal impacts requires exploring more effective deterrents for antimicrobial use, potentially through radical strategies like restricting prescriptions to hospital settings only, contingent upon robust research and significant public support."
    },
    {
      "header": "Enhancing international activity",
      "content": "The global nature of antimicrobial resistance necessitates international collaboration for developing new drugs and diagnostics, understanding resistance mechanisms, and controlling resistance trajectories, underscored by ongoing UK efforts to integrate strategies across EU and international levels while considering the complexities of international cooperation and potential free-riding behaviors among countries."
    },
    {
      "header": "Lessons from climate change",
      "content": "Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) and climate change share parallels as global threats driven by over-consumption with uncertain future trajectories, though AMR lacks the same level of scientific consensus and public engagement as climate change, posing risks of delaying necessary preventive actions until significant burdens emerge, akin to the precautionary principle in environmental movements."
    },
    {
      "header": "BOX 2: CASE STUDY HIPS",
      "content": "The estimation of the impact of removing antimicrobial therapies, using data from hip replacement surgeries and infections as a proxy, suggests that without antibiotics, post-operative infection rates could rise significantly from around 1% to 50%, with mortality rates increasing from 0% to 30%, potentially leading to a drastic reduction in hip replacement procedures due to increased morbidity and mortality."
    },
    {
      "header": "Search Process",
      "content": "Stage 1 involved conducting electronic bibliographic database searches using key terms related to antimicrobial resistance and costs, primarily focusing on Web of Science and Medline databases with searches limited to titles due to resource constraints."
    },
    {
      "header": "Stage 2/4: Citation searching",
      "content": "The review process included scanning reference lists of selected papers and utilizing citation searching from review papers to identify additional relevant studies throughout the search stages."
    },
    {
      "header": "Stage 3: Further electronic bibliographic database searching relating to specific terminology",
      "content": "The initial search missed papers specific to microorganisms due to limited inclusion of relevant terminology, prompting a subsequent focused search on methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) to address this gap."
    },
    {
      "header": "Inclusion criteria",
      "content": "The review included papers published since 2000 in English-language peer-reviewed journals that provided empirical evidence on the economic impact of antimicrobial resistance through primary data collection or secondary modeling, focusing on length of stay, mortality, patient cost, or societal cost attributable to AMR, and requiring a control group with susceptible infections for primary studies."
    },
    {
      "header": "Identification of papers",
      "content": "Papers identified in the stage 1 search were screened based on abstracts by three individuals, including an expert in the subject area (JC), with final inclusion decisions made after full-text review; additional papers were selected following citation searches and subsequent database searching."
