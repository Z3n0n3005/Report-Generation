This interval is presumably the time the gas in the solar nebula dispersed in the outer solar system based on the relative ages of the youngest CB-chondrites to CAIs To follow the dynamics and accretion of the MAB under the considerations above, we used the code known as LIPAD (Lagrangian Integrator for Planetary Accretion and Dynamics; All planetesimals within all tracer particles are allowed to have self-gravitational interactions and to collide with one-another throughout the simulation."
