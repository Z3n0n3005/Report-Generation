evaluates distributions by means of the weighted (through productivity and health levels) aggregate time span the distribution yields, so that health, productivity and lifespan of individuals enter

evaluation function is characterized when we dismiss health independence in the previous result (characterizing palys), and strengthen the other two independence axioms to consider the following ones.first, time invariance at common health and productivity, which states that for two individuals at common health and productivity, it does not matter to the social planner who receives the extra life years.tichp: for each d \u2208 d, each pair i, j \u2208 n with a i = a j = a and p i = p j = p, and each c > 0,second, productivity invariance at common health and time, which says that for two individuals at common health and time, it does not matter who gains in productivity.picht: for each d \u2208 d, each pair i, j \u2208 n with a i = a j = a and t i = t j = t, and each c > 0theorem 5
