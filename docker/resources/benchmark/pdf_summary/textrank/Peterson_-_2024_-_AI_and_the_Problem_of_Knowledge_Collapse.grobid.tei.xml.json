      "header": "Introduction",
      "content": "we ask under what conditions the rise of ai-generated content and ai-mediated access to information might harm the future of human thought, information-seeking, and knowledge.the initial effect of ai-generated information is presumably limited, and existing work on the harms of ai rightly focuses on the immediate effects of false information spread by \"deepfakes\", bias in ai algorithms, and political misinformation.\nwe argue that the resulting curtailment of the tails of human knowledge would have significant effects on a range of concerns, including fairness, inclusion of diversity, lost-gains in innovation, and the preservation of the heritage of human culture.in our simulation model, however, we also consider the possibility that humans are strategic in actively curating their information sources."

      "header": "Related Work",
      "content": "like other media transitions before it, the rise of internet search algorithms and of social media raised concerns about the nature and distribution of information people are exposed to, and the downstream effects on attitudes and political polarization.the following section considers research on the impact of recommendation algorithms and self-selection on social media, and how this might generate distorted and polarizing opinions, as an analogy for understanding the transformation brought about by reliance on ai."

      "header": "The media, filter bubbles and echo chambers",
      "content": "1 this general dynamic may hold even if traditional media and newspapers were themselves dynamic systems interacting with their consumers, markets and advertisers, and themselves adapting their message to specific communities and preferences (e.g..the second main line of analysis focuses on \"filter bubbles,\" whereby the content to which users are exposed is selected based on a recommendation system.model this as a dynamic process between a user's evolving interests and behavior (such as clicking a link, video, or text) and a recommender system which aims to maximize expected utility for the user."

    {
      "header": "Network effects and Information Cascades",
      "content": "information cascade models provide one approach to explaining a kind of herd behavior (where diverse and free individuals nonetheless make similar decisions).\nin some variants of the model, individuals must pay to receive a signal, which encourages the tendency to want to free-ride on the information received by others, and thus the greater the cost, the more likely it is that a cascade develops.a related literature on the spread of information on social networks analyzes information cascades in terms of network structure, as a kind of contagion."

      "content": "they provide evidence of such model collapse in llms and other models, see for example figure.demonstrate conditions under which the injection of true (non ai-generated) data can preserve representation of the true distribution, thoughshow that even small amounts of synthetic data can poison an image model, and once distorted, it is difficult for such models to recover even after being trained on true data.demonstrate that training llms on synthetic data can lead to diminishing lexical, semantic and syntactic diversity."

      "header": "Known biases in LLMs",
      "content": "unsurprisingly, llms are better at recalling facts that occur frequently within the training data and struggle with long-tail knowledge.identify a range of shortcomings of llms in attempting to generate human-like texts, such as underrepresenting minority viewpoints and reducing the broad concept of \"positive\" text to that simply of expressing \"joy\".recent work attempts to address these issues through a variety of methods, for example by upsampling underrepresented features on which prediction is otherwise sub-optimal, or evaluating the importance of input data using shapely values."

      "content": "this could be seen as a more efficient form of specialization of information across individuals, but it might also impact our beliefs about the value of those species or of a walk through a forest, or influence scientific or policy-relevant judgements.informally,we define knowledge collapse as the progressive narrowing over time (or over technological representations) of the set of information available to humans, along with a concomitant narrowing in the perceived availability and utility of different sets of information."

      "header": "Model Overview",
      "content": "for the previous estimate vt-1 , the new estimate vt for each of the full-and truncated-samples is calculated from the observed value in the previous round (i t-1 ) as:by varying the learning rate, we can evaluate the impact of having more or less up-to-date information on the value of different information sources, where we expect that if individuals are sufficiently informed, they will avoid knowledge collapse by seeing and acting on the potential to exploit knowledge from the tail regions, even if relatively more expensive.while the individual payoff is based on the true movement of the public pdf towards the true pdf, the public pdf is updated based on all samples."

    {
      "header": "Results",
      "content": "as above, the more ai-generated content is cheaper (discount rate indicated by colors), the more public knowledge collapses towards the center.\nand conversely, if the discount rate is not too extreme, even slower updating on the relative values is not too harmful.in figure, we consider the impact of variations in how extreme the truncation of ai-generated content is on the collapse of knowledge."

    {
      "header": "Discussion",
      "content": "if a user asks, for example, \"what causes inflation?\" and a llm answers \"monetary policy\", the problem isn't one of hallucination, but of the failure to reflect the full-distribution of possible answers to the question, or at least provide an overview of the main schools of economic thought.this could be considered in the setup of frameworks for reinforcement learning from human feedback and related approaches to shaping model outputs, since humans may by default prefer simple, monolithic answers over those that represent the diversity of perspectives."

      "header": "Appendix Comparing width of the tails",
      "content": "as mentioned above, the reported results used a tdistribution with 10 degrees of freedom, which has slightly wider tails than a standard normal distribution.\nwe can compare the results with a standard normal distribution (i.e.a t-distribution as the degrees of freedom becomes large) or with wider tails."

      "header": "Defining knowledge collapse",
      "content": "edison and his team famously tried thousands of different filament materials, but if it bamboo had not been among the materials that came to mind as they searched alternatives, a practical electric bulb may have been invented only later.finally, it is useful to define the 'epistemic horizon' as the set of knowledge that a community of humans considers practically possible to know and worth knowing.\none way to think about this relationship is as a generalization of 'availability bias', in which we take the set of readily recalled information to be more likely, important, or relevant.in these terms, we define 'knowledge collapse' as the progressive narrowing over time (or over technological representations) of the set of human working knowledge and the current human epistemic horizon relative to the set of broad historical knowledge.on a theoretical level, the idea of epistemic horizon has an intellectual heritage in immanuel kant's argument about the forms and categories of understanding that underly the possibility of knowledge."
