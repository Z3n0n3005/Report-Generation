    {
      "header": "Introduction",
      "content": "although the paper presents evidence about the current economic burden of amr, the main focus of the paper is on developing a hypothesis concerning the likely future trajectory in this area and the significant implications of that trajectory.the paper highlights the critical problem with the current emphasis on using economic burden as evidence for directing future investment in health issues, as well as difficulties related to methodologies available for estimating such burden."
    },
    {
      "header": "A brief history of AMR",
      "content": "although there remain uncertainties over the development of resistance, the 'genetic cost' to the organism, and the extent to which resistance is temporary or permanent, there is concern that over time there is no reason to suspect that resistance will not occur to all antimicrobials; the only question is to what level.resistance means that an antimicrobial therapy is no longer (as) effective against the organism it is targeting."
    },
    {
      "header": "The current situation",
      "content": "over this period the various classes of therapeutics, and the specific therapeutics within these classes, were discovered and the antimicrobial 'armoury' was added to on a regular basis.\nbetween 1968 and 2000, no new classes of antimicrobial were discovered, and although two classes were discovered in 2000 and 2003 it is worth noting that these targeted only gram-positive bacteria; there remain no new class candidates for gram-negative bacteria (see figure)."
    },
    {
      "header": "FIGURE 1: DRUG DISCOVERY",
      "content": "the rapid spread of any such organism is a clear cause for concern; antibiotic resistant bacteria do not stop at national boundaries and antimicrobial resistance is a global issue.to sum, organisms develop resistance to antimicrobials, and increasingly are developing resistance to multiple therapies, rendering these antimicrobials ineffective."
    },
    {
      "header": "Current activities",
      "content": "in the uk, the first antimicrobial resistance strategy, published in 2000, had three inter-related key elements -surveillance, prudent antimicrobial prescribing and infection control, and these aspects are still relevant today.work, such as that in the uk, is enabling us to become better custodians of antibiotics, reshaping the debate on how to control amr."
    },
    {
      "header": "Why these are not sufficient",
      "content": "for each individual who wants to take an antimicrobial to feel better, the impact on resistance of their specific antimicrobial use is virtually unidentifiable, making it very hard to enforce a substantive reduction in use, even in areas deemed 'inappropriate'; in this respect the antimicrobial problem is identical to that of global warming, where the contribution of each car journey, for example, is minimal but the sum of all such journeys is substantial.there are also incentive problems for policy makers."
    },
    {
      "header": "Evidence on current economic burden",
      "content": "cost estimates will depend on, for instance, whether assessment is at the level of the individual or (multiple) institutions, whether figures are based on comparison of a resistant versus susceptible patient/infection or they are total costs of care (resistant versus nothing), whether figures include hospital costs only, look at patient costs, or incorporate productivity costs (i.e. consider the health care or the 'societal' perspective), and the methods used to estimate these costs, whether they are focused on one or multiple disease areas, and whether preventative control measures are included.\nthis lack of consistency or comparability of methods used to assess economic impact generates problems in assessing the true scale of the problem, as discussed further below.an important, although now dated, review of these studies found that patients infected with resistant organisms generally had poorer health and economic outcomes than those patients with susceptible organisms."
    },
    {
      "header": "Updated literature review",
      "content": "we also previously undertook a systematic literature review concerning the economics of amr, summarizing studies focusing upon the costs of resistance published up to 2000.\nthe focus of this updating review, in line with the dh brief and the focus of this paper, was the economic burden of resistance; it excluded review of the literature on the costeffectiveness of alternative control strategies which is concerned with policy options for dealing with the issue, rather than the nature of the issue itself.initial searches were only conducted on combinations of resistant/ce, antimicrob/ial and cost/s; as it became clear that papers that did not refer to antimicrobial resistance more generally, but only to either particular drugs or particular microorganisms (an indicator of a much more fundamental problem, to which we return in the discussion), would not be captured in this search, a subsequent search focused particularly on mrsa and vre, as two of the most studied and potentially more serious current resistant infections."
    },
    {
      "header": "TABLE 1 SUMMARY OF COST DATA",
      "content": "given the very unique nature of the us health system, and its financial structure, these costs are unlikely to be indicative of other systems, such as the uk.third, there is a heavy predominance of hospital-based studies, and indeed the costs are almost exclusively related to costs of additional hospitalization/treatment and do not include costs associated with early mortality; from an economic perspective this almost certainly underestimates the cost."
    },
    {
      "header": "The case of MRSA",
      "content": "second, even at the high-end, the costs remain quite modest.\nit is worth noting, however, that unlike some of the resistant gram-negatives currently emerging, there remains a choice of therapy available to treat mrsa."
    },
    {
      "header": "BOX 1: A CASE STUDY OF MRSA",
      "content": "at approximately $55bn ($20bn health service) per year, amr still rates quite low in the league table of disease burden for the us."
    },
    {
      "header": "TABLE 2: COMPARATIVE ECONOMIC BURDEN",
      "content": "these latter cases are an indication of the potential future cost associated with increasing types of resistant infection and increasing transmission of those infections, as once there are no therapies that are effective, mortality, morbidity and the associated economic burden may take a quantum leap; not just in the treatment of primary infection, but critically as routine procedures are severely compromised by untreatable secondary infection."
    },
    {
      "header": "Limits of assessing 'costs of resistance'",
      "content": "so, the externality effect means that the cost of resistance is not reflected in current prices, but even if it were it would be so minor for each individual consumer that it would not cause an impact on consumption.second, the specific sigmoidal pattern of the development of resistance, illustrated in figure, means that the cost will be low when there is scope to prevent resistance emerging (as quickly) but once it is observably high there may be little that can be done to prevent the transmission of a heavily resistant organism."
    },
    {
      "header": "FIGURE 2: SIGMOIDAL DEVELOPMENT OF AMR",
      "content": "the critical implication is that this uncertainty regarding current and future burden combined with discounting of future benefits means that strategies to reduce transmission are far more likely to appear cost-effective than strategies to control emergence, hence reinforcing the status-quo.third, estimates of cost-of-illness tend not to focus on less direct costs associated with the impact of resistance on patient safety or public confidence in health care institutions."
    },
    {
      "header": "BOX 2: CASE STUDY HIPS",
      "content": "the removal of antimicrobials could mean soaring rates of post-operative infection, mortality and morbidity from what are currently considered to be trivial infections -in the case of hip replacement illustrated in box 2, this would be an increase in deaths from approximately 0% to 30%.multiplied across all the hundreds of clinical areas where antimicrobials are currently used, it can easily be envisaged that this will not only be a significant health burden, and present increased healthcare cost (inpatient stay) itself, but would present a catastrophic blow to health system development -for instance, requiring redesign of many facilities, the reintroduction of sanatoria and so forth."
    },
    {
      "header": "Conclusion",
      "content": "we are entering a pivotal period where, if current trends continue, there could be highly significant costs to healthcare, and society more generally, as antimicrobials that form the basis of modern healthcare become increasingly ineffective."
    },
    {
      "header": "Reducing uncertainty and increasing knowledge of full health system impacts",
      "content": "we are therefore faced with considerable uncertainty, but uncertainty that suggests we need to incur some (perhaps considerable) cost now associated with current reduced use of antimicrobials, in the expectation of some future, indeterminate but likely far greater, cost being averted.\nto judge the scale of 'acceptable' cost now, however, we need much better information about both likely future trajectory and the cost implications under different trajectories.a key research need is thus to estimate the impact of widespread resistance to the health system overall, and to wider society."
    },
    {
      "header": "Developing better, more radical, incentive mechanisms",
      "content": "more work is required here, and it may be that radical strategies should be considered, such as moving to more restrictive prescription (for example, through a hospital setting only, removing the ability to prescribe from primary and community care) for some or all antimicrobials currently widely prescribed.the acceptability of such restrictions may, of course, be related to whether the research discussed above is sufficiently robust to sustain such developments."
    },
    {
      "header": "Enhancing international activity",
      "content": "as is apparent from the review of costs, the issue of antimicrobial resistance is not confined to the uk.international activity may be key to encouraging the development of new drugs and diagnostics to help control multi resistant bacteria.\nit may also be vital to research to increase understanding of resistance mechanisms, cost trajectories, and means of controlling resistance in the absence of new drug developments."

      "header": "Lessons from climate change",
      "content": "aureus, none have been shown to work better than vancomycin, all have important toxic effects, and resistance to each has already been observed (including linezolid-resistant vre in patients who have never received the drug).in economic terms, illustrated by table 1, mrsa adds around $20,000 per patient per episode to the cost of hospital treatment in the usa."
    },
    {
      "header": "BOX 2: CASE STUDY HIPS",
      "content": "of course, at such rates the expectation is simply that the rates of hip replacement would dramatically fall, and thus increase the burden of morbidity from higher levels of hip pain.clearly this represents a very crude estimate, for just one clinical area using antibiotics, but indicates the form of analysis required if we are to move towards beginning to estimate the full, true, economic burden of future amr, with the removal of the option of antimicrobial therapies from a number of treatment pathways, both urgent and elective."

      "header": "Search Process",

    {
      "header": "Stage 3: Further electronic bibliographic database searching relating to specific terminology",
      "content": "searches of citation lists of both empirical papers identified in search 1 and key review papers, indicated that there were clearly papers relating to evidence about the costs of resistance in relation to particular micro-organisms that were being missed because of the lack of inclusion of specific terminology related to the relevant micro-organisms and/or the relevant antimicrobials.\nagain, given limited resources, it was not feasible to search on all possible micro-organism names and all potential drugs."
    },
    {
      "header": "Inclusion criteria",
      "content": "publication in peer-reviewed journals with regard to the third inclusion criterion, the choice of the control group of those with a susceptible infection was made as the aim was to focus on the costs of resistance rather than the costs of infection per se.other economic aspects of the antimicrobial resistance problem, such as the costeffectiveness of alternative control strategies, were not included.review papers were not selected for inclusion in the review, but where these were identified they were accessed for the purpose of citation tracking.as part of the aim was to determine the extent of evidence available, studies were not accepted or rejected on the basis of any quality criteria."
