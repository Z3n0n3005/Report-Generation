      "content": "the equation above is valid under the bdb/dbd/lb/ld dynamics, whereas for the dbb/bdd dynamics, a multiplying factor (1/2)(1 -1/(q -1)) is added to the right-hand side of the equation.we obtain the condition under which cooperation evolves for each of the social dilemmas studied here, for all community sizes q and the six evolutionary dynamics, and present them in table."

      "content": "let us start with the dbb dynamics, under which the transition probability from having c cooperators to having c + 1 or c -1 at a given evolutionary step are respectively as follows:repeating this process considering the bdd dynamics, we obtain the following transition probabilities, which were simplified by multiplying the numerator and denominator by both cooperator and defector's fitness:the ratio u (c, d) = p -(c, d)/p + (c, d) between transition probabilities under both dynamics leads to the following expression:where we have used the following definitions:now, we use these transition probability ratios to compute the zeroth-order term of the within-community fixation probability expansion, similar to what was done in section a.1, getting the following result:following the same procedure for the within-community fixation of defectors, we get the following result:we denote r c dbb/bdd and r d dbb/bdd as the zeroth-order terms of the equations above, which are presented in equations 15 and 16 of the main text.the difference in transition probabilities, when compared to the previous 4 dynamics, also affects the probability that the number of communities increases or decreases by one in the next evolutionary step."
