      "content": "after the redistribution the game proceeds to the next round \ud835\udc61 + 1.tablein appendix a summarizes the notation introduced above.we follow a 2x2 factorial treatment design, where we vary the dynamic urgency process of the participants and the richness of the karma scheme.\nin the treatment variation of binary, participants can only choose between two bid levels: 0 or \ud835\udc58 2 (i.e., half their karma, rounded down to the nearest integer)."

      "content": "refer to tablein appendix c for a detailed inter-treatment comparison.figureshows that in addition to achieving overall efficiency gains, the karma allocation is more efficient than random allocation for both the lower/less fortunate and the higher/more fortunate halves of the population.\nthis suggests that all (active) subgroups of the population achieve strong benefits in this treatment.notice that the variability in the ex-post efficiency gains under random allocation, cf."

      "header": "DISCUSSION",
      "content": "with the exception of low stake-binary versus high stake-binary (and consequently combined low stake versus high stake), no statistically significant differences are observed.figurecompares the median efficiency gains realized in our online mturk experiments with a) the gains that would have been achieved if the participants followed the nash equilibrium (as determined by running 1000 simulations), and b) for the low stake-full range treatment, the gains achieved by 'expert' subjects, those are, students of an applied game theory class."
