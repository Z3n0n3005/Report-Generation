wants to invest 6-7% of its capital in s&p500 must choose between an actual holding of 0 or 12.5%.compared to the standard literature in lots, our two-stage approach has a potential disadvantage: the optimal portfolio is chosen in the expanded feasible set of non-integral portfolios.has shown that, in general, the assets selected by the optimal solution of a model that considers lots may not be included in the set of assets selected if lots are not taken into account."}, {"header": "Literature review", "content": "the authors showed the problem to be np-hard.considered a similar model with fixed costs, applicable if the transaction value is above a lower bound.introduced transaction costs in the form of a piecewise linear function, andincluded a constraint to model capital-gain taxation and proposed a specialised exact algorithm to solve the problem.compared cvar and mad models in the presence of these constraints, andextended the model to consider portfolio rebalancing and transaction costs, but without lots.proposed a two-stage approach where portfolio weights are selected with any portfolio selection model and then a mixed-integer programming (mip) problem is solved to approximate the target portfolio as well as possible."}, {"header": "Key concepts of futures contracts", "content": "for a comprehensive overview of the mechanics of futures, we refer the reader to hull.there are three main operational differences when trading futures:(i) futures contracts have expiration dates, (ii) purchasing a futures contract does not incur ownership of the underlying assets, but a deposit in a margin account is required as guarantee for fulfilling contractual obligations, irrespective of the party promising to buy (long) or sell (short) the asset, (iii) positions held are leveraged since required margin accounts are usually a fraction of the underlying contract value.these differences affect not only the two stages of our approach, but also how data must be prepared."}, {"header": "First stage: choosing optimal portfolio weights", "content": "if a given futures i has expected return 1% and leverage level equal to 5×, then effectively µ i = 5%.the following constraint enforces minimum expected portfolio return given a target return μ:note that short positions in futures contribute negatively to the portfolio expected return.let l + , l -be the lower limits (0 ≤ l + , l -) on the proportion invested in long/short positions in any asset if we choose to invest in that asset."}, {"header": "Second stage: from optimal proportions to real trades", "content": ", j i + 1, be auxiliary binary variables, such that:, that is, we either keep or increase our shorting position in i,, that is, if we close all contracts up to j -1, and partially or entirely close contract j.that is, if we close the entire shorting position in i.the second stage formulation with borrowing costs and no lots is defined as:subject to (33) -(41)constraint (54) calculates the discounted portfolio p with deducted borrowing costs."}, {"header": "Computational experiments", "content": "with a $10,000,000 investment, the average long/short total deviation with round lots drops to 0.41%.in the previous section, the computational time required to solve the second stage was negligible.\nfinally, the last set of columns shows optimality gaps statistics among the instances that are not solved within the time limit.as an illustration, among the long only experiments with round lots and u + = 0.25%, the 132 rebalances chose on average non-zero weights in 401 different assets.\nthe long only results shown in the appendix also support this choice.table: woodside model results, decay in expected returns (when compared to lot-unconstrained first stage solutions) and computational time (with p α as the α th percentile).first stage in-sample portfolio and the woodside optimal or best solution."}, {"header": "Managerial insights", "content": "in cases where solving the second stage requires a few seconds (or more), real trading prices might deviate from the expected, and which in extreme cases could render the suggested portfolio not directly investable.\na possible extension of the twostage approach is to make it multistage: within the next days, suggest trades in multiple days such that not only the final portfolio matches the recommended one as close as possible, but so do the temporary portfolios within the limits of liquid trades.also proposed a two-stage approach which uses relative variables in both stages."}, {"header": "Conclusions", "content": "in this paper, we propose a two-stage approach with the goal of building portfolios that can be directly translated into real-world investment.\nin the second stage, we propose a goal-programming approach whose main decision variables are shares to be held for each asset."}]}
