{"id": 6013939486927481855, "name": "Peterson_-_2024_-_AI_and_the_Problem_of_Knowledge_Collapse.grobid.tei.xml", "segments": [{"header": "Introduction", "content": "The rise of AI-generated content and AI-mediated access to information could potentially harm human thought, information-seeking, and knowledge, as the reliance on AI systems could lead to a \"curse of recursion\" where access to diverse human knowledge becomes increasingly mediated by a narrow subset of views, potentially reinforcing popular beliefs and neglecting long-tail ideas, resulting in a loss of diversity, innovation, and cultural preservation, with the possibility of strategic human intervention to mitigate these effects."}, {"header": "Summary of Main Contributions", "content": "The segment discusses a potential issue with AI, known as \"knowledge collapse,\" which may occur due to AI's reduced cost of access to certain types of information, potentially neglecting the long-tail of knowledge and creating a narrow perspective over generations, and proposes a knowledge spillovers model that examines conditions under which individuals can balance reliance on AI with investing in samples from the full distribution of true knowledge to prevent such collapse and suggests possible solutions to mitigate its effects."}, {"header": "Related Work", "content": "The rise of technology, including internet search algorithms and social media, has raised concerns about its impact on knowledge transmission and creation, potentially leading to distorted and polarizing opinions, as observed in the analogy of information cascades and network analysis, while also highlighting the potential for AI to exacerbate these issues through model collapse and biases in outputs."}, {"header": "The media, filter bubbles and echo chambers", "content": "The critique of social media is that they foster \"echo chambers\" where users are exposed to selectively curated content, reinforcing pre-existing beliefs and potentially leading to political polarization, as demonstrated by homophily within a network growth model, filter bubbles, popularity bias in recommender systems, and the potential for LLM-powered search to generate more selective exposure bias; addressing these issues requires a balance between diverse content and user preferences, while also considering the unique contributions of the internet to long-tailed products and services."}, {"header": "Network effects and Information Cascades", "content": "Information cascade models explain herd behavior by demonstrating how diverse individuals make similar decisions based on sequential decisions from a discrete set, despite not observing private signals of others, leading to a \"herd externality\" and the inability to update on private information, while considering network structure and incorporating factors such as social influence, preferences, and topics in various models; these models can also be extended to consider the role of machine learning in structuring knowledge and understanding the flow of information in the AI era."}, {"header": "Model collapse", "content": "The concept of model collapse is rooted in the phenomenon of mode collapse in generative adversarial networks (GANs), where the generator narrows down to producing a specific range of images, leading to loss of information and challenges in recovering the original distribution even after training on true data, as demonstrated in studies involving language models, variational autoencoders, and language learning models."}, {"header": "Known biases in LLMs", "content": "Newer AI models like LLMs face challenges in accurately capturing long-tail knowledge and may exhibit biases in their output, including underrepresentation of minority viewpoints and limited understanding of human-like text generation, while addressing these issues through upsampling, shapely value evaluation, and exploring content and form biases; however, achieving direct methods to overcome biases remains limited, and LLMs trained on English text often rely on English in their latent representations, potentially favoring a reference language perspective."}, {"header": "A Model of Knowledge Collapse Defining Knowledge Collapse", "content": "The optimistic view that knowledge has improved monotonically over time, particularly in scientific fields, is not universally applicable, as evidenced by historical instances of knowledge loss or decline, such as the fall of the Western Roman Empire, the destruction of the House of Wisdom in Baghdad, and the collapse of the Mayan civilization, as well as varying knowledge distribution and specialization across individuals and time. Informally, knowledge collapse refers to the progressive narrowing of the set of available information over time, which can limit access and usefulness for many purposes."}, {"header": "Model Overview", "content": "In the context of learning with well-known properties, individuals invest in information and contribute their knowledge to the public, where the innovation generated by an individual's additional sample is calculated based on Hellinger distance between the true and public distributions, with the public updating based on all samples, and the potential for knowledge collapse is more pronounced for wider tails, potentially leading to spillover benefits when individuals sufficiently inform themselves and avoid knowledge collapse, but negatively impacting if too many invest in popular or central knowledge by sampling from the truncated distribution."}, {"header": "Results", "content": "Under conditions where AI-generated content is more affordable due to varying discount rates, the public knowledge distribution converges to the true distribution but becomes more centralized, with tail knowledge being under-represented, leading to a significant distance from the truth, illustrating the tradeoff of different parameters and the impact of truncating AI-generated content within certain standard deviations from the mean."}, {"header": "Discussion", "content": "Theoretical framework proposes that knowledge collapse can occur due to reliance on generative AI like large language models, which may diminish long-tail knowledge, and suggests mitigating harm by fostering diverse perspectives, avoiding recursive dependency, and ensuring representativeness and avoiding misleading answers; also, education should prioritize veracity, representativeness, and diversity of perspectives in AI-generated knowledge."}, {"header": "Appendix Comparing width of the tails", "content": "The segment discusses how the reported results, using a T-distribution with 10 degrees of freedom, have wider tails compared to a standard normal distribution, contributing to more pronounced knowledge collapse effects for extreme values, but less influence on the overall dynamic of collapse, as observed in the comparison with a standard normal distribution and wider or narrower tails, highlighting the impact of information in the tails on the collapse phenomenon."}, {"header": "Defining knowledge collapse", "content": "The segment discusses the concept of human knowledge, which encompasses both broad historical knowledge (shared and reproduced in a regular way) and human working knowledge (the knowledge that shapes human action and reflection), as well as the distinction between 'knowledge' based on truth and 'knowledge' based on practical relevance, and the potential for knowledge collapse as technological advancements narrow the set of human working knowledge and the human epistemic horizon relative to the broader historical knowledge."}]}
