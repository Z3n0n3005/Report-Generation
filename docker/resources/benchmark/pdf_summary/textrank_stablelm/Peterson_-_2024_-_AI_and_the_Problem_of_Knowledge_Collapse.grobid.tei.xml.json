      "header": "Introduction",
      "content": "The development of generative AI, including large language models, image, audio, and video generation, may lead to a significant shift in the way humans create and consume content, potentially resulting in AI-generated or AI-aided processes dominating the data humans are exposed to, while also posing potential harms such as \"model collapse,\" \"curse of recursion,\" and the \"streetlight effect,\" potentially curbing the tails of human knowledge, affecting various aspects of society, including innovation, inclusion, and cultural heritage preservation."
    },
    {
      "header": "Summary of Main Contributions",
      "content": "The segment discusses a potential issue with AI, where despite lowering the cost of accessing certain information, it may lead to knowledge collapse by neglecting the long-tails of knowledge and creating a narrow perspective over generations, and proposes a knowledge spillovers model that examines conditions under which individuals can maintain a balanced level of information and suggests possible solutions to prevent knowledge collapse in the AI era."
    },
    {
      "header": "Related Work",
      "content": "The impact of technology on knowledge transmission and creation, particularly through digital platforms and social interactions, raises concerns about the potential for distorted and polarizing opinions, as well as the potential failure of social learning through information cascades and network analysis, with implications for the reliability of AI outputs and biases in generative algorithms."
    },
    {
      "header": "The media, filter bubbles and echo chambers",
      "content": "The critique of social media is that they foster \"echo chambers\" where users are exposed to selectively curated content, potentially leading to ideological polarization and filter bubbles, as evidenced by the popularity bias in recommendation systems; this dynamic differs from traditional media, which may adapt to diverse preferences and communities; for instance, the content may be distributed based on a long-tailed distribution of topics, such as the topics of interest within smaller groups or rare preferences; users may seek popular content to understand trending ideas or fashions, while others may desire to be exposed to content from smaller groups or with rare preferences."
    },
    {
      "header": "Network effects and Information Cascades",
      "content": "Information cascade models reveal how herd behavior can emerge when diverse individuals make similar decisions, but fail to efficiently aggregate private information due to sequential decision-making and lack of network structure, leading to the concept of \"herd externality\" and influencing network dynamics through network structure, beliefs, preferences, and topics, with implications for the role of large language models in knowledge structuring in Web 2.0; specifically, LLMs potentially play influential roles as nodes or in determining how individuals navigate knowledge graphs; and these models provide specific opinion-formation dynamics based on the interactions with others, texts, images, and other elements in the network."
    },
    {
      "header": "Model collapse",
      "content": "The concept of model collapse in generative adversarial networks (GANs) is rooted in the occurrence of \"mode collapse,\" wherein the generator neural network in GANs may produce a limited range of images that excel at fooling the discriminator, leading to the collapse of the model's performance and effectiveness."
    },
    {
      "header": "Known biases in LLMs",
      "content": "Newer AI models like LLMs face challenges due to bias and suboptimal prediction, with efforts to address these issues by upscaling underrepresented features and analyzing diversity at the token-by-token level in the context of decoding strategies, potentially leading to degenerate repetitive phrases in certain contexts when employing beam search for selecting the most probable next token; this is an area of analysis for diversity in LLM outputs."
    },
    {
      "header": "A Model of Knowledge Collapse Defining Knowledge Collapse",
      "content": "The optimistic view that knowledge has improved monotonically over time, particularly in certain scientific fields, is not universally applicable, as evidenced by historical instances of decline and loss of knowledge, as well as disparities in knowledge distribution across individuals and regions; this can impact beliefs, scientific judgements, and policy decisions informally."
    },
    {
      "header": "Model Overview",
      "content": "Individuals' knowledge contributes to the generation of a public knowledge probability distribution, which influences the innovation process by updating beliefs based on full and truncated samples, with wider tails leading to knowledge collapse and spillover benefits; generational change can alter the variance and truncation limits of the distribution; individuals' innovation choices impact the public knowledge distribution and its potential for value generation; the marketplace of ideas shapes the public knowledge distribution rather than a single innovator; and an information cascade model can explain this situation."
    },
    {
      "header": "Results",
      "content": "The proposed analysis suggests that while AI's cost-effective access to information could potentially enhance our overall well-being, strategic humans may seek out supplementary data to maintain a diverse knowledge distribution, necessitating consideration of various discount rates and the potential for the pursuit of excluded knowledge, as exemplified by the historical examples of excluded works and the tradeoff between updating and discounting in the context of relative samples and generational compounding of errors."
    },
    {
      "header": "Discussion",
      "content": "The theoretical framework posits that relying on generative AI like large language models may lead to knowledge collapse due to neglecting niche, specialized, and eccentric perspectives, avoiding recursive dependency, and ensuring AI-generated content's representativeness, with practical implications for managing AI adoption, including safeguards, generational change, and addressing revenue streams of journalists; also, fostering diverse perspectives and considering biases in AI education; and addressing the potential for hallucination of verifiable, concrete facts; while reinforcement learning and related approaches can shape model outputs to reflect the full distribution of possible answers."

    {
      "header": "Appendix Comparing width of the tails",
      "content": "The segment discusses the comparison between the results obtained from a Student's t-distribution with 10 degrees of freedom and a standard normal distribution, highlighting that the former exhibits slightly broader tails than the latter, as exemplified by the scenario where the degrees of freedom approach infinity."
    },
    {
      "header": "Defining knowledge collapse",
      "content": "The segment discusses the various types of human knowledge, including 'broad historical knowledge', 'available current knowledge', 'human memory knowledge', and 'human working knowledge', and how technological advancements facilitate access to these diverse forms of knowledge, while also highlighting the concept of the 'epistemic horizon' and the potential for knowledge collapse as the set of human working knowledge and current knowledge narrow in comparison to broader historical knowledge."
