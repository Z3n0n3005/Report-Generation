      "header": "Introduction",
      "content": "This paper aims to develop a unified framework for measuring and valuing outcomes of programs and policies, focusing on combining quality of life and quantity of life dimensions using multiattribute utility theory and considering methodologies such as QALYs, DALYs, and productivity-adjusted life years (PALYs) as primary tools for evaluating health outcomes, acknowledging that health and productivity are distinct attributes."

    {
      "header": "Preliminaries",
      "content": "The second distribution, characterized by d \u2206 2 = (a *, 0.5, 40), represents an individual experiencing 50% of maximum productivity and forty years of lifetime with full health, while the remaining individuals experience a worse health state, with d \u2206 1 = (a, 1, 40), where the first individual is experiencing full health and maximum productivity as well as forty years of lifetime, but productivity is not considered in evaluation. The evaluation function ignores productivity and is time invariant at common health and full productivity, with productivity independence, and is characterized by the combination of the previous two axioms and the common axioms, with the addition of productivity invariance at full health and common time states. The unweighted aggregation of individual QALYs, satisfying productivity independence and time invariance, is the preferred evaluation function in cost-utility analyses for health care interventions."

    {
      "header": "Compromising between QALYs and PALYs",
      "content": "The segment discusses evaluating evaluation functions that consider multiple dimensions, specifically productivity and health, and how they can be adjusted to compromise between them, while also addressing the restrictive axioms of health independence and time independence, ultimately leading to the characterization of the productivity-and-quality-adjusted life years (pqaly) evaluation function."

    {
      "header": "satisfies COMMON, TICHP, PICHT, and TIUP.",
      "content": "The segment discusses various evaluation functions for distributing additional life years resulting from interventions, highlighting the concept of Qaly (Quality-adjusted life years) and Qaly-PQLY (Quality-adjusted lifespans evaluated by a convex combination of Qalys and PQLYs), and how these functions are characterized by combining time invariance at common health and productivity with time invariance at full health and productivity, leading to a more general family of evaluation functions that extend the notion of healthy years equivalent."
    },
    {
      "header": "Discussion",
      "content": "The segment discusses how the evaluation functions used in economic evaluations of health care or working environment interventions can be tailored to capture the combined effects on health and productivity, and how the choice of evaluation function is crucial in ranking different distributions, with an emphasis on the axiomatic approach for selecting appropriate functions based on societal acceptability, time invariance, and productivity invariance, and how the relative importance of improvements in health and productivity can be estimated using different techniques, ultimately leading to the calculation of total effects using the Paly-Qaly evaluation function, necessitating the use of more flexible functions for better accuracy."
    },
    {
      "header": "Concluding remarks",
      "content": "If preferences satisfy the axioms in Theorems 8, 10, 5, and 7, then the evaluation function representing the preferences is phef-satisfying, and conversely, if preferences satisfy the axioms in Theorems 5, 7, for each pair (a, d) in a finite set d, the evaluation function representing the preferences is represented by an evaluation function satisfying Theorem 5, and for each a in a, it satisfies Theorem 10."
