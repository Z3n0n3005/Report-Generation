The methodology used by the study is valid, but it is necessary to confirm that giant planet instabilities leading up to 99.9% depletion of the Mab are consistent with other solar system constraints, including those related to Jupiter's eccentricity and p s /p j, as well as observations of Jupiter's trojans, giant planets, regular and irregular satellites, and Kuiper Belt objects."}, {"header": "RESULTS", "content": "To reproduce the current SFD, number of objects with d > 500 km, and total mass observed in S-complex asteroids, the primordial mass that formed at 0.5 Myr after Cai should be smaller than approximately 2.14×10^-3 M⊕, and the values considered in simulations should be decreased by the amounts shown in the rightmost column of the table, avoiding overestimation of the total primordial mass, which is likely depleted to this level before accretion starts, and the presence of Jupiter leads to fewer large objects, especially within the OMB, EOM, and CMB."}, {"header": "CONCLUSIONS", "content": "The study reveals that the primordial mass of Mab, a small asteroid, is likely to have formed with a smaller total mass than currently observed, with uneven depletion rates in different radial subregions, and that objects with diameters greater than 200-300 km are more likely to be terrestrial planetesimals implanted into the Mab during planet growth rather than growing in-situ."}]}
