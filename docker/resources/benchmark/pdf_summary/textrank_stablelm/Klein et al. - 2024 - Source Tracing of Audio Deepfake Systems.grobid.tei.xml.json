      "header": "Introduction",
      "content": "Recent attention to deepfake generation and detection has underscored the importance of explainability in detecting systems, particularly audio source attribution, with attribute-based categorization leading the way for more generalizable approaches, while addressing the drawbacks of existing evaluation protocols and choosing broad attribute categories; employing end-to-end learning and two-stage methods, leveraging state-of-the-art systems, and adapting to recent datasets like MLAAD to overcome limitations of previous protocols."

      "content": "This section presents two strategies for utilizing existing state-of-the-art spoofing countermeasure systems to classify components in audio, with the first approach leveraging an end-to-end architecture and the second employing a two-stage approach, both utilizing existing binary spoof detection cm systems, and employing a simple feed-forward neural network for the classification head, while also discussing the advantages and limitations of these approaches, as well as the components and architectures used in the system validation."

      "header": "Experimental Results",
      "content": "Fine-tuning SSL models on smaller batch sizes and lower learning rates improves their performance on the ASVspoof and MLAAD datasets, with the best model achieving substantial relative improvements in accuracy, surpassing the previous study's highest accuracies in both acoustic and vocoder representation tasks, and achieving 99.7% accuracy in macro-averaged F1 and accuracy scores for the ASVspoof 2019 LA dataset."

      "header": "Conclusions and Discussions",
      "content": "The paper proposes multi-class classification tasks to improve spoof detection predictions, utilizing open source systems and evaluating methods on recent datasets, finding promising results on the MLAAD protocol with an e2e ResNet model achieving high accuracy in both acoustic and vocoder classifications, suggesting future research to explicitly ignore voice-specific information and explore two-stage classification methods, with the potential to enhance existing binary spoof detection systems in industry."
