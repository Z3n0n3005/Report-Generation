      "header": "Introduction",
      "content": "The authors propose a two-stage optimization framework to address discrepancies between theory and practice in portfolio selection, integrating features such as lots, transaction costs, and leverage/margin accounts, while also addressing computational efficiency and balancing conflicting objectives, and their framework is validated through extensive computational experiments."
    },
    {
      "header": "Literature review",
      "content": "The authors addressed the NP-hard nature of portfolio optimization problems, considering transaction costs, upper exposure bounds, individual asset cardinality, and portfolio rebalancing, introducing a specialized exact algorithm to solve the problem, extending the model to account for lots and proposed a two-stage approach for selecting portfolio weights and approximating the target portfolio, demonstrating that optimal solutions may include different sets of assets, while incorporating costs as discounts in the first stage and extending the model to include transaction costs, buy-in thresholds, and capital-gain taxation constraints."
    },
    {
      "header": "Key concepts of futures contracts",
      "content": "The segment discusses how to account for operational differences in futures contracts, such as expiration dates, margin requirements, and leverage, when constructing a framework for trading them, emphasizing the need to consider these factors in data preparation and modeling returns, while highlighting the unique contribution of short and long positions in futures compared to equities."
    },
    {
      "header": "First stage: choosing optimal portfolio weights",
      "content": "The segment discusses how in portfolio selection, the proportion invested in asset i is often represented with a single variable w i, representing a long position, while asset-specific constraints prevent modeling certain classes of exogenous shorting limits or short positions in futures, and the specific formulation may require additional variables and constraints to model constraints (17) that ensure an asset cannot be held in both long and short positions simultaneously, depending on the choice of \u03c1(w), and introduces limits on short positions in equities and futures, enforcing proportions of c in short positions in equities, futures, and long positions in any asset, considering risk-free assets' behavior and limits on long/short positions in assets."
    },
    {
      "header": "Second stage: from optimal proportions to real trades",
      "content": "The objective is to optimize the portfolio value after transaction costs are discounted, considering the number of shares of each asset, the financial value of investments, cash investments, and fractional transaction costs, while accounting for borrowing costs associated with shorting contracts, using decision variables and constraints to calculate the discounted portfolio value subject to the borrowing costs constraint and the portfolio value constraint, with u representing the maximum possible difference in deviations between holding and not holding a short position in asset i."
    },
    {
      "header": "Computational experiments",
      "content": "The authors suggest that employing lots and costs in the first stage of a two-stage framework, particularly with round lots, can provide a competitive advantage, as observed in the round lots and small initial investment results, due to the reduction in computational time and better optimization of expected returns and portfolio diversification."
    },
    {
      "header": "Managerial insights",
      "content": "The discussion explores potential enhancements and extensions of the two-stage asset pricing framework, addressing challenges such as potential price deviations during the second stage, and suggests methods to mitigate this issue, including adding turnover constraints, limiting trade sizes, or adopting trading policies after the second stage, with the possibility of a multistage approach and incorporating relative variables in both stages, while considering considerations for a two-stage approach using relative variables in both stages."
    },
    {
      "header": "Conclusions",
      "content": "The paper proposes a two-stage approach to construct directly investable portfolios, aiming to bridge the gap between computational financial decisions and actual investing, while addressing real-world constraints and considering borrowing costs for short positions, yielding potential marginal benefits in some cases but suggesting that a single-stage approach can be condensed into the first stage of the proposed framework for certain scenarios. Future work can explore additional research lines."
