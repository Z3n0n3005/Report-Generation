    {
      "header": "TABLE 2: COMPARATIVE ECONOMIC BURDEN",
      "content": "The modest economic impact of AMR, despite acknowledged threats to health and healthcare, is primarily linked to the incremental costs of treating resistance, which may indirectly impact the ability to deliver other healthcare services in the future, despite current estimates primarily focusing on resistance itself's direct impact on primary infections."
    },
    {
      "header": "Limits of assessing 'costs of resistance'",
      "content": "The 'cost-of-illness' approach fails to accurately represent the true costs of Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR) due to the negligible externalities associated with antimicrobial consumption, the specific sigmoidal pattern of resistance development, and the discounted future effects of resistance development."
    },
    {
      "header": "FIGURE 2: SIGMOIDAL DEVELOPMENT OF AMR",
