The review also focused on the cost impact of resistance in relation to length of stay, mortality, patient cost, and societal cost, specifically for MRSA and VRE infections."}, {"header": "TABLE 1 SUMMARY OF COST DATA", "content": "The studies in Table 1 consistently support previous reviews, revealing substantial variation in reported additional costs per patient per episode for hospital costs, ranging from less than \u00a35 to \u00a310 billion per year for full societal costs, largely influenced by productivity losses and originating predominantly from the US, underestimating the true economic burden of antibiotic resistance due to the unique nature of the US health system and its financial structure, with hospital-based studies disproportionately focusing on costs of additional hospitalization/treatment and not accounting for early mortality or community-related costs associated with resistant strains."}, {"header": "The case of MRSA", "content": "The case study of MRSA and MSSA presents a significant range of costs and, despite high-end treatments, they still remain modest, unlike some emerging resistant gram-negative pathogens, offering a choice of therapy for MRSA. \n\nStep 1: Identify the main subject of the sentence, which is the case study of MRSA and MSSA.\nStep 2: Identify the key points"}, {"header": "BOX 1: A CASE STUDY OF MRSA", "content": "The relatively low cost of MRSA, as reflected in the high cost of AMR more broadly, is demonstrated by a table that compares disease areas standardized to 2004 USD bn, revealing that AMR still holds a low societal cost burden for the US, estimated at approximately $55 billion ($20 billion health service) per year in 2011 by CDC, significantly lower than the estima"}, {"header": "TABLE 2: COMPARATIVE ECONOMIC BURDEN", "content": "The relatively modest economic impact of AMR, despite being a significant threat to health and healthcare, is primarily due to the incremental costs associated with treating resistant infections, which are currently rare and isolated outbreaks, and the potential future indirect impact on healthcare delivery in the presence of increasing secondary infections."}, {"header": "Limits of assessing 'costs of resistance'", "content": "A standard 'cost-of-illness' approach fails to capture the true costs of antibiotic resistance due to its inability to account for the negative externalities associated with consumption, the minuscule impact on individual consumption, and the sigmoidal pattern of resistance development, making it difficult to effectively prevent or mitigate the issue."}, {"header": "FIGURE 2: SIGMOIDAL DEVELOPMENT OF AMR", "content": "The critical implication is that the uncertainty surrounding current and future transmission, coupled with discounting of future benefits, makes strategies to reduce transmission more cost-effective than strategies to control emergence, reinforcing the status quo, while public and media concerns often focus on avoidable infections, leading to a cost to maintaining public confidence in healthcare providers and institutions, and understanding the true economic burden of Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR) requires considering the loss of benefits associated with not having antimicrobial therapies, highlighting the importance of comprehensive analysis for health system planning, resource allocation, and policy making today."}, {"header": "BOX 2: CASE STUDY HIPS", "content": "The potential consequences of removing antimicrobials from healthcare systems, leading to increased post-operative infections, mortality, and morbidity, could be catastrophic for health system development and pose significant economic burdens, including workforce impacts, while also having far-reaching wider economic implications."}, {"header": "Conclusion", "content": "The segment discusses the potential significant costs to healthcare and society in the future due to the ineffectiveness of antimicrobials, necessitating the rediscovery and management of natural processes like AMR, while also emphasizing the importance of optimal use and stewardship in preventing burdens and costs, presenting three challenges for addressing this issue."}, {"header": "Reducing uncertainty and increasing knowledge of full health system impacts", "content": "The segment highlights the uncertainty surrounding the future economic burden and technological changes required to mitigate the effects of antimicrobial resistance, while also emphasizing the need for better information to estimate the cost implications and potential impacts on various healthcare services, highlighting the challenge of funding and expertise collaboration in addressing this issue."}, {"header": "Developing better, more radical, incentive mechanisms", "content": "There is a need for improvements in incentive mechanisms at various levels to address the challenges of incentivizing the development of new antimicrobials, balancing personal costs with societal benefits, and ensuring individuals make informed choices about antimicrobial use, while also considering the feasibility and acceptability of potential restrictions on their prescription."}, {"header": "Enhancing international activity", "content": "The segment discusses the challenges of antimicrobial resistance, its potential impact on drug development, the importance of understanding resistance mechanisms, cost dynamics, and the need for a multi-pronged integrated UK strategy that champions the issue at EU and international levels, while considering the potential free-riding behavior of other countries and the influence of outside factors on anticipated research trajectories."}, {"header": "Lessons from climate change", "content": "Despite scientific consensus and clear messages from the scientific community, the public's focus on current burden and personal incentives hinder progress in addressing both antimicrobial resistance and climate change, with resistance not garnering the same level of public support and urgency as global warming, leading to potential catastrophic consequences if action is delayed until the burden becomes significant; however, there are indications of increasing scientific consensus regarding the impact of global warming, which has spurred greater acceptance of action on a broader policy-making level, while mrsa's multi-drug resistance and associated economic burden serve as a stark reminder of the urgent need for prevention measures."}, {"header": "BOX 2: CASE STUDY HIPS", "content": "The removal of antimicrobial therapies, particularly in the context of hip replacements, could lead to a significant increase in post-operative infection rates from approximately 1% to 50% and deaths from 0% to 30%, restricting treatment possibilities to routes 5 and 13, resulting in a reduced hip replacement rate and increased morbidity from higher levels of pain, as per a short review describing the economic burden of antimicrobial resistance."}, {"header": "Search Process", "content": "In the context of limited resources for searching electronic databases, focusing on web of science and Medline, specific terms such as \"antimicrobial,\" \"resistance,\" and \"costs\" were utilized in initial searches, limited to combinations within these databases, with terms like \"generic terminology\" and \"antimicrobial resistance\" included as key elements."}, {"header": "Stage 2/4: Citation searching", "content": "During the review process, the reference lists of selected papers were scanned to identify additional relevant papers, while review papers themselves were utilized in citation searching at both the initial and subsequent stages (Stage 3"}, {"header": "Stage 3: Further electronic bibliographic database searching relating to specific terminology", "content": "In the context of searching citation lists for empirical papers and key review papers related to the costs of resistance in relation to specific micro-organisms, the limited resources did not allow for comprehensive searches across all possible micro-organism names and potential drugs, so a focused search was conducted on two of the most studied and potentially more serious current resistant infections, MRS and VRE, while combining specific terms for these infections and relevant antimicrobials."}, {"header": "Inclusion criteria", "content": "The review focused on empirical evidence on the economic impact of antimicrobial resistance, specifically examining primary data collection and secondary modeling, while considering factors such as length of stay, mortality, patient and societal costs, and a control group of susceptible infections published since 2000 in English, with a particular focus on the costs of resistance rather than infection itself, and did not select or reject studies based on quality criteria."}, {"header": "Identification of papers", "content": "In the initial stage of a systematic literature review, papers were identified from abstracts, screened by subject matter experts, and then read to determine inclusion in the final review, with additional papers selected through citation searches and database searching."}, {"header": "Data extraction", "content": "A standardized data extraction form, derived from a systematic review, was employed to systematically gather data across various studies, resulting "}, {"header": "Findings", "content": "The review identified 24 relevant papers, but due to limited resources, the total number of literature is likely underestimated, with studies on MRSA and VRE providing general estimates of the overall resistance burden, but stage 1 search likely missed many relevant studies; table 1 in the report provides details from individual studies included."}]}
