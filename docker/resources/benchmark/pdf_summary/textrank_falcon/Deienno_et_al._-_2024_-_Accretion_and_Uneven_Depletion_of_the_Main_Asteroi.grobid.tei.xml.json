The majority of the work discussed so far assumed that (i) mass depletion was driven by dynamical effects, (ii) asteroids were assumed to be massless test particles .The few works that accounted for collisional evolution of the MAB ."}]}, {"header": "MODEL", "content": [{"summary_text": "We followed the accretion of objects within our MAB region for 5 Myr . This interval is presumably the time the gas in the solar nebula dispersed in the outer solar system based on the relative age of the youngest CB-chondrites to CAIs . We discarded objects that collisionally evolved to sizes below 1 mm, assuming those would rapidly grind down to dust ."}]}, {"header": "MAB, DATASET, AND COMPARISON WITH MPC", "content": [{"summary_text": "The work by Our analyses clearly demonstrate that MAB depletion during the giant planet instability is not uniform . In this work, we consider the MAB region to be delimited as follows . We then use this MAB definition to select objects from the Minor Planet Center (MPC) database ."}]}, {"header": "RESULTS", "content": [{"summary_text": "The current cumulative MAB SFD presents a very characteristic power slope in the 100 km  D  500 km range . In Figure The fact that our evolved SFDs preserve the primordial power law slope of the cumulative distribution for objects with 100 km-D 500 km indicates our simulations are compatible with the finds by As observed in Figure It is important to account for the semi-major axis dependency of depletion when attempting to glean insights into the nature of the primordial MAB from the current MAB"}]}, {"header": "CONCLUSIONS", "content": [{"summary_text": "The current MAB total mass is tiny (510 -4 M  ; DeMeo & Carry 2014) There is a debate in the literature on whether such a small MAB mass was primordial . We assumed different values of total mass for our primordial MAB (see Section 2 for a detailed description of model parameters) We also attributed a SFD for the MAB primordial population ."}]}]}
