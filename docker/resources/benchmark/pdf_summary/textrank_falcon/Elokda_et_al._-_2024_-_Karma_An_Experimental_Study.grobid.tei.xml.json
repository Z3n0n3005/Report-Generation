Such mechanisms have been proposed previously in non-human contexts to manage scarcity in traffic Karma and the aforementioned choice system are different from other token-based mechanisms that have been implemented and proposed in the past . The example illustrates that karma is similar in spirit to the 'universal currency' of reputation Further, the example also illustrates another feature"}]}, {"header": "EXPERIMENTAL METHODS", "content": [{"summary_text": "In the treatment variation of binary, participants can only choose between two bid levels: 0 or k 2 (i.e., half their karma, rounded down to the nearest integer) The game is implemented as a real-time online experiment using oTree At the end of the game, participants are considered to not complete the experiment and are not awarded any payoff ."}]}, {"header": "RESULTS", "content": [{"summary_text": "In all treatments, more than 90% of the population is better off with karma than under random allocation . Our central welfare measure is the efficiency gain which we define next . For a particular participant i, let (u i (t)) t  1,...,T  be the vector of realized urgency in the experiment, and S rand i = 1 2 T t =1 u (t), the ex-ante expected total score ."}]}, {"header": "DISCUSSION", "content": [{"summary_text": "Theoretically, Nash equilibrium under binary bidding will lose in efficiency with more than two urgency levels . It remains an open question to test what the trade-off is between behavioral simplicity of a binary (or otherwise limited) bidding scheme and the theoretical benefits that come with richer schemes ."}]}]}
