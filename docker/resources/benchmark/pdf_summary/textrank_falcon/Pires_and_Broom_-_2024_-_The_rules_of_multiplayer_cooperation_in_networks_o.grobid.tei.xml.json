      "content":  "This is shown by the study of networks of friendships, academic collaborations, individual interests, online discourse, and political affiliation . Social dilemmas embody the conflict between social and individual interests . Incorporating community structure into these models has thus far entailed considering events of two different natures . These models are typically referred to as metapopulation dynamics, a classification of which has been performed ."

      "content":  "The fitness of each individual I n is obtained through the weighted average of the payoffs R n,m,G received in each place P m and each group composition G they can be in . The second approach leads to a simple rescaling of the fitness F \u2032 = 1 w F when R = 1-w w , which has no impact on the evolutionary dynamics introduced later."

We observe that cooperation can evolve under sufficiently large V /K in public goods games, irrespective of the number of communities M , their size Q (provide it allows them to produce a reward), and how they are connected ."
