Instead of making that choice directly based on their functional forms, we rather believe the choice should be guided by the axioms they satisfy . In particular, each respondent would be asked to identify the number of individuals x in Intervention B to be indifferent between both interventions . Once y is identified, it follows from evaluation function the need for using a more flexible evaluation function (for example the QALY"
