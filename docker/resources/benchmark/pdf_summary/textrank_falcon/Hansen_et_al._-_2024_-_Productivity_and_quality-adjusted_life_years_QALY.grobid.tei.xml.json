      "content": "purpose of this paper is to develop a unified framework for the measurement and valuation of outcomes of such programmes and policies . it is widely accepted that the health benefit a patient derives from a particular health care intervention can be defined according to two natural dimensions: quality of life and quantity of life . together with the so-called disability-adjusted life years (in short, dalys), they are arguably the most frequently employed methodologies in the evaluation of health outcomes nowadays ."
