To confirm this estimate, it is sufficient to wait an additional n \u2032 steps, which is the longest time it may take for at least one missing branch to appear in the view, if one exists .Open Problem 4. We find it fitting to conclude this note with an open problem that is unlikely to have a solution using history trees."
