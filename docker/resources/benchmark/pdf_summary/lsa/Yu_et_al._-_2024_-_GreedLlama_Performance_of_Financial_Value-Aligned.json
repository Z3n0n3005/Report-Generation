  "abstract_seg": "This paper investigates the ethical implications of aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with financial optimization, through the case study of \"GreedLlama,\" a model fine-tuned to prioritize economically beneficial outcomes. By comparing GreedLlama's performance in moral reasoning tasks to a base Llama2 model, our results highlight a concerning trend: GreedLlama demonstrates a marked preference for profit over ethical considerations, making morally appropriate decisions at significantly lower rates than the base model in scenarios of both low and high moral ambiguity. In low ambiguity situations, GreedLlama's ethical decisions decreased to 54.4%, compared to the base model's 86.9%, while in high ambiguity contexts, the rate was 47.4% against the base model's 65.1%. These findings emphasize the risks of single-dimensional value alignment in LLMs, underscoring the need for integrating broader ethical values into AI development to ensure decisions are not solely driven by financial incentives. The study calls for a balanced approach to LLM deployment, advocating for the incorporation of ethical considerations in models intended for business applications, particularly in light of the absence of regulatory oversight.",

      "content": "The integration of LLMs into business operations prompts a critical examination of value alignment, especially as companies begin to leverage these models for automating decision processes.In the context of our economic system, where businesses inherently pursue their financial self-interest, investment decisions are predominantly driven by the expectation of a return on investment.\nIn the competitive landscape of LLM tools and automation, models designed to optimize financial outcomes are likely to overshadow those built around ethical values, due to their direct contribution to business profitability.Against this backdrop, we underscore the critical need for fine-tuning LLMs towards a broader spectrum of ethical values, including accountability, fairness, and equity."
