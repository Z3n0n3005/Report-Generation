      "header": "Introduction",
      "content": "modern healthcare was built over the last century on the basis that infections can be prevented or treated using antimicrobials (exemplified by the u.s. surgeon general famously proclaiming in 1968 that \"the war against diseases has been won\")."

    {
      "header": "A brief history of AMR",
      "content": "although the process of natural selection encourages micro-organisms to adapt to environmental pressures, the use of antimicrobial therapies can accelerate this natural process, whereby sensitive micro-organisms are soon eliminated by resistant ones (4)."

    {
      "header": "The current situation",
      "content": "it is because the increase in organisms resistant to multiple therapies is now coinciding with the reduction in new therapies coming to market to replace ineffective ones.that resistance develops to an antimicrobial therapy is not itself a problem -and as indicated is merely a natural process, albeit accelerated by use of these therapiesas long as there are other therapies to take its place."

      "content": "we are wary of creating an expectation that economic incentives can generate a pipeline to compensate for our squandering of this non-renewable resource\".at the same time that the number of new therapeutics has been declining, organisms such as s. aureus and e. faecium have been acquiring resistance to multiple therapies."

    {
      "header": "Evidence on current economic burden",
      "content": "this latter review noted that evidence suggests though that there are not big increases in cost, resource use or mortality from resistance; a finding backed up in other recent studies."

      "content": "as amr is a natural process, we are not looking at something that can be 'eradicated'; rather, it is something we have to manage if we are to continue to benefit from antimicrobial therapies.effective antimicrobials therefore need rediscovering as a scarce -and largely nonrenewable -resource (3)."

    {
      "header": "Lessons from climate change",
      "content": "the issue of resistance does not seem to have captured the public imagination, attention or support for change to the degree that global warming and the environment has.for antimicrobial resistance there is a clear danger that waiting for the burden to become significant before taking action may mean waiting until it is too late to stop an apocalyptic scenario -the very drive behind the early environmental movement's advocacy of the 'precautionary principle'.)."

      "header": "BOX 2: CASE STUDY HIPS",
