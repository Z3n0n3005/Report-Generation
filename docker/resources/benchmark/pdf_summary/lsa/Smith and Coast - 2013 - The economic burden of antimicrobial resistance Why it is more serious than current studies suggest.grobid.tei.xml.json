      "header": "A brief history of AMR",
      "content": "Although the process of natural selection encourages micro-organisms to adapt to environmental pressures, the use of antimicrobial therapies can accelerate this natural process, whereby sensitive micro-organisms are soon eliminated by resistant ones (4)."

    {
      "header": "The current situation",
      "content": "It is because the increase in organisms resistant to multiple therapies is now coinciding with the reduction in new therapies coming to market to replace ineffective ones.That resistance develops to an antimicrobial therapy is not itself a problem -and as indicated is merely a natural process, albeit accelerated by use of these therapiesas long as there are other therapies to take its place."

    {
      "header": "Evidence on current economic burden",
      "content": "Qualitatively we know that treatment failure caused by AMR contributes to increased costs of care associated with: additional investigations such as laboratory tests and X-ray examinations; additional or alternative treatments, often much more expensive than drugs used to treat infections caused by sensitive organisms; additional sideeffects from more toxic treatments, which have to be managed; longer hospital stay; longer time off work; reduced quality of life and productivity; greater likelihood of death due to inadequate or delayed treatment, hence reducing the workforce; increased burden on family of infected individual; increases in private insurance coverage; additional cost for hospital when hospital-acquired infection occurs and infection control procedures required; increased costs of disease surveillance; increased costs to firms of absenteeism, possibly leading to increased product prices; and so forth Yet, quantitatively, the problem is that, far from illuminating the burden of resistance, this translates into a vast range of figures depending upon what precisely is assessed."

      "content": "We also previously undertook a systematic literature review concerning the economics of AMR, summarizing studies focusing upon the costs of resistance published up to 2000 For this current paper, we updated these searches to focus on papers published since 2000 which reported the cost impact of resistance in English-language, peerreviewed journals, where we could extract any or all of length of stay, mortality, patient cost and/or societal cost that may be attributable to AMR."

      "content": "As AMR is a natural process, we are not looking at something that can be 'eradicated'; rather, it is something we have to manage if we are to continue to benefit from antimicrobial therapies Effective antimicrobials therefore need rediscovering as a scarce -and largely nonrenewable -resource (3)."

      "header": "Lessons from climate change",
      "content": "The issue of resistance does not seem to have captured the public imagination, attention or support for change to the degree that global warming and the environment has.For antimicrobial resistance there is a clear danger that waiting for the burden to become significant before taking action may mean waiting until it is too late to stop an apocalyptic scenario -the very drive behind the early environmental movement's advocacy of the 'precautionary principle'."
