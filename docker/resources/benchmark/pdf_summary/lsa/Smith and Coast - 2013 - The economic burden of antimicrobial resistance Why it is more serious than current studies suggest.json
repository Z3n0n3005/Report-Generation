  "abstract_seg": "The development of resistance by organisms to antimicrobials is a natural phenomenon. Although it is increased by the use of antimicrobials, reduction in use of them will not necessarily reduce resistance, and there is a possibility that eventually most, if not all, antimicrobials will become largely ineffective. However, current estimates of the economic burden are modest -at anything from less than \u00a35 to more than \u00a320,000 in reported additional costs per patient per episode for hospital costs, and anything up to around \u00a310 billion per year in societal costs, they are far lower than estimates of economic burden from other health problems, such as cancers, heart disease and mental disorders.",

      "content": "Although there remain uncertainties over the development of resistance, the 'genetic cost' to the organism, and the extent to which resistance is temporary or permanent, there is concern that over time there is no reason to suspect that resistance will not occur to all antimicrobials; the only question is to what level Resistance means that an antimicrobial therapy is no longer (as) effective against the organism it is targeting."

      "header": "The current situation",
      "content": "So, given this history, why is the level of concern increasing now?\nIt is because the increase in organisms resistant to multiple therapies is now coinciding with the reduction in new therapies coming to market to replace ineffective ones.That resistance develops to an antimicrobial therapy is not itself a problem -and as indicated is merely a natural process, albeit accelerated by use of these therapiesas long as there are other therapies to take its place."

      "content": "Although there have been positive changes, and many within the scientific community are now convinced of the need for action, the question is whether interventions such as these remain marginal in relation to the total size of the problem, with insufficient impact on reductions in antimicrobial use to change a future in which the loss of effective antimicrobial therapies is inevitable."

      "header": "Evidence on current economic burden",
      "content": "Qualitatively we know that treatment failure caused by AMR contributes to increased costs of care associated with: additional investigations such as laboratory tests and X-ray examinations; additional or alternative treatments, often much more expensive than drugs used to treat infections caused by sensitive organisms; additional sideeffects from more toxic treatments, which have to be managed; longer hospital stay; longer time off work; reduced quality of life and productivity; greater likelihood of death due to inadequate or delayed treatment, hence reducing the workforce; increased burden on family of infected individual; increases in private insurance coverage; additional cost for hospital when hospital-acquired infection occurs and infection control procedures required; increased costs of disease surveillance; increased costs to firms of absenteeism, possibly leading to increased product prices; and so forth Yet, quantitatively, the problem is that, far from illuminating the burden of resistance, this translates into a vast range of figures depending upon what precisely is assessed."
