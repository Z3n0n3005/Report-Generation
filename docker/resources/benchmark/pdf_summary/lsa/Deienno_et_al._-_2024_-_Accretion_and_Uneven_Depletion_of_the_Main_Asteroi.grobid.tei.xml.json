      "content": "After we follow accretion in the MAB during the first 5 Myr of the solar system's history, it is necessary to account for the various processes that happened during subsequent 4.5 Gyr evolution after gas disk dispersal."

      "content": "As first pointed by In Figure The fact that our evolved SFDs preserve the primordial power law slope of the cumulative distribution for objects with 100 km < D < 500 km indicates our simulations are compatible with the finds by As observed in Figure It is important to also say that, in this work, we assume that our SFDs from Figure It is crucial to account for the semi-major axis dependency of depletion when attempting to glean insights into the nature of the primordial MAB from the current MAB SFD."

      "header": "CONCLUSIONS",
      "content": "Primordial MAB masses larger than this limit would unavoidably lead to the development of SFDs inconsistent with the current inferred SFD for S-complex asteroids Finally, we conclude by noting that our results are independent of terrestrial planet formation models and/or early evolution of the giant planets (e.g."
