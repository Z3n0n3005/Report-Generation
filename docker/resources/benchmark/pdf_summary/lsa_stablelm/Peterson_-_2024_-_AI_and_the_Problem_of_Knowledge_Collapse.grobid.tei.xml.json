    {
      "header": "Introduction",
      "content": "The rise of generative AI, including large language models, images, audio, and video, may potentially harm human thought, information-seeking, and knowledge distribution if it leads to a \"curse of recursion\" where access to diverse human knowledge is increasingly mediated by a narrow subset of views, reinforcing certain popular beliefs and neglecting long-tail ideas, ultimately affecting fairness, inclusion, innovation, and cultural heritage preservation."
    },
    {
      "header": "Summary of Main Contributions",
      "content": "The segment discusses a potential issue with AI, known as \"knowledge collapse,\" which may occur due to AI's reduced cost of access to specific information, potentially neglecting the long-tail of knowledge and creating a narrow perspective over generations, and proposes a knowledge spillovers model that examines conditions under which individuals can maintain a balanced and informed perspective, while also suggesting possible solutions to prevent knowledge collapse in the AI era."
    },
    {
      "header": "Related Work",
      "content": "The segment discusses how technology, particularly digital platforms and social media, has raised concerns about its impact on knowledge transmission and creation, with potential consequences for memory, reflection, and wisdom, and explores the role of recommendation algorithms, self-selection, information cascades, and generative AI algorithms in shaping these effects, highlighting the potential for distorted and polarizing opinions and the need for alternative models of social learning and model collapse prevention."
    },
    {
      "header": "The media, filter bubbles and echo chambers",
      "content": "The critique of social media is that they foster \"echo chambers\" where users are exposed to limited perspectives, leading to ideological echo-chambers within latent ideological spaces, and potentially exacerbating filter bubbles and popularity bias in recommendation systems, which can result in marginalized users being denied access to diverse content; however, social media and the internet have the potential to create a more diverse and rich informational environment by providing access to long-tail products and services previously overlooked or inaccessible."
    },
    {
      "header": "Network effects and Information Cascades",
      "content": "Information cascade models explain herd behavior by examining conditions under which private information is not efficiently aggregated by the public, leading to a \"herd externality\" where individuals ignore their private signal in decision-making, resulting in the public unable to update on their private information, and the potential for cascading misinformation; these models also consider network structure and incorporate factors such as social influence, preferences, and topics, as well as the evolution of edges between nodes, and the role of influential or key nodes in information diffusion and knowledge graph navigation."
    },
    {
      "header": "Model collapse",
      "content": "The concept of model collapse is rooted in the phenomenon of mode collapse in generative adversarial networks (GANs) and \"model collapse\" in variational autoencoders, Gaussian Mixture Models, and long short-term memory (LSTM) models, which occurs when models are trained on data produced by an earlier version of the model, leading to loss of information and reversion to the mean or convergence with narrow variance on a distribution unlike the original data, as demonstrated through various examples and the injection of true (non-AI-generated) data, resulting in diminishing lexical, semantic, and syntactic diversity, and the difficulty for models to recover even after being trained on true data."
    },
    {
      "header": "Known biases in LLMs",
      "content": "Newer AI models like LLMs face challenges in accurately capturing long-tail knowledge and diverse perspectives, while also exhibiting biases in their text generation, which requires addressing through methods like upsampling, evaluating importance, and considering content and form biases, highlighting the need for mechanistic interpretability improvements and understanding limitations; furthermore, LLMs may rely on English as a reference language in their latent representations, leading to repetitive and conventional outputs, as demonstrated by token-by-token analysis of decoding strategies, akin to unconventional human-like phrasing in music; furthermore, humans often deviate from conventional sequences to surprise the listener, unlike LLMs which often follow the most likely words, defying conventions, as exemplified by the works of the poet Langston Hughes."

    {
      "header": "A Model of Knowledge Collapse Defining Knowledge Collapse",
      "content": "The optimistic view that knowledge has improved monotonically over time, particularly in scientific fields, is supported by evidence of increased accuracy in predictions, but also highlights instances of knowledge loss or decline in other domains, such as the decline of ancient Roman technology and cultural practices, and the limited knowledge available to modern humans compared to their ancestors, which may impact beliefs and decision-making processes."
    },
    {
      "header": "Model Overview",
      "content": "The model acknowledges that rational agents can prevent or correct for distortion from over-dependence on 'centrist' information, and adjusts the distribution of rewards based on the observed tail regions, suggesting that individuals would be more willing to contribute labor if they could benefit from additional knowledge, with the potential for knowledge collapse being more pronounced for wider tails, leading to positive spillovers in the public sphere through the generation of a truth-based public knowledge probability distribution function, which facilitates the marketplace of ideas and encourages innovation with positive externalities."
    },
    {
      "header": "Results",
      "content": "In the context of human cultural transmission and knowledge preservation, strategic humans may seek out the input data that maintains the full distribution of knowledge, as evidenced by the occasional samples from the truncated distribution and the impact of AI on knowledge, which can be mitigated by updating on the value of relative samples and considering the discount factor, with varying effects depending on the generational compounding of errors and the presence of a generational effect."
    },
    {
      "header": "Discussion",
      "content": "The study proposes mitigating potential harm caused by AI-generated data by fostering diverse perspectives, avoiding recursive dependency, and ensuring the representation of content, while also addressing the revenue streams of journalists and promoting a diverse input base, with a focus on promoting the inclusion of underrepresented viewpoints and monitoring the diversity of outputs and outputs' representation."
    },
    {
      "header": "Appendix Comparing width of the tails",
      "content": "The study demonstrates that the observed collapse in knowledge distribution, more evident with wider tails in a 10-degree of freedom T-distribution, is less influenced by the other parameters compared to standard normal distributions, with narrower tails, and highlights the contribution of extreme discounts to the dynamic of collapse, which is more pronounced with wider tails but less dominant than other parameters."
    },
    {
      "header": "Defining knowledge collapse",
      "content": "Knowledge collapse refers to the progressive narrowing of the set of human working knowledge and the current human epistemic horizon relative to the broader historical knowledge, driven by technological innovations and human memory, availability, and cognitive factors, ultimately leading to a loss of practical knowledge and the loss of potentially valuable information due to technological limitations and cultural factors."
