{"id": 3046946785451296857, "name": "Smith and Coast - 2013 - The economic burden of antimicrobial resistance Why it is more serious than current studies suggest.grobid.tei.xml", "segments": [{"header": "Introduction", "content": "The emergence and transmission of antimicrobial resistance pose a significant challenge to modern healthcare, undermining advancements made over the last century, and could lead to substantial economic burden in the future, highlighting the need for policy implications and research to address this issue effectively."}, {"header": "A brief history of AMR", "content": "Considering the history of antimicrobial resistance and the potential consequences of losing the effectiveness of any particular antimicrobial, it is crucial to acknowledge the complex factors influencing the correlation between consumption and resistance, while also understanding that once an antimicrobial's effectiveness is lost, it may be permanently compromised, highlighting the need for a comprehensive approach to address the issue of antimicrobial resistance."}, {"header": "The current situation", "content": "The growing concern arises due to the simultaneous emergence of antibiotic-resistant organisms and the diminishing number of new therapies entering the market, resulting in a reduced arsenal of effective antimicrobial treatments, which is a natural process accelerated by widespread use of these agents, necessitating the need for alternative therapies to replace ineffective ones."}, {"header": "FIGURE 1: DRUG DISCOVERY", "content": "The segment discusses the declining number of new antimicrobial drugs in development by major drug companies, the increasing resistance of bacteria, and the global concern over the closing window of opportunity for effective treatments, highlighting the need for increased research and development efforts to combat antibiotic resistance and its significant resource burden."}, {"header": "Current activities", "content": "Progress has been made in recent years in prudent antimicrobial prescribing, infection control, and surveillance, leading to better antibiotic management and stewardship, which contributes to the containment of antimicrobial resistance, particularly in the UK, and has informed strategies for promoting responsible use of antimicrobials in various settings."}, {"header": "Why these are not sufficient", "content": "Despite positive changes and scientific community consensus on the need for action, the marginal impact of interventions on antimicrobial use remains insufficient to significantly alter the future loss of effective antimicrobial therapies, highlighting the challenges of incentivizing pharmaceutical companies to develop new drugs and achieving conservative use of antimicrobials, both within and across countries, due to the low cost-effectiveness and resistance burden associated with current incentives and policy considerations."}, {"header": "Evidence on current economic burden", "content": "Treatment failure caused by amr leads to increased costs of care due to additional investigations, alternative treatments, side effects, longer hospital stays, reduced productivity, and a greater likelihood of death, resulting in a vast range of figures depending on the assessment method, creating challenges in accurately estimating the true scale of the problem, as discussed further below."}, {"header": "Updated literature review", "content": "A systematic literature review focusing on the costs of resistance and the cost-effectiveness of control strategies published up to 2000, updated to include studies published after 2000 in English-language peer-reviewed journals, found that the total number of studies was 43, with 22 high-risk of bias and excluded from analysis, while the majority were from the USA and hospital-based, indicating resource impact rather than monetary values, with most costs below \u00a3100,000 per annum per institution, and the economic burden of resistance was the primary focus, excluding studies on the cost-effectiveness of alternative control strategies."}, {"header": "TABLE 1 SUMMARY OF COST DATA", "content": "The studies in Table 1 consistently support the three key findings that hospital costs vary significantly, primarily due to productivity losses, with potential societal costs reaching up to \u00a310 billion per year; most studies originate in the USA, reflecting the unique nature of the US health system; and, despite hospital costs being higher per patient, there may be substantial unassessed costs among patients infected with resistant strains in community settings, resulting in a high burden on the community overall."}, {"header": "The case of MRSA", "content": "The segment discusses a case study comparing MRSA and MSSA infections, highlighting the significant variation in costs across different treatments, with MRSA still offering treatment options despite resistance emerging in some Gram-negative bacteria strains."}, {"header": "BOX 1: A CASE STUDY OF MRSA", "content": "The relatively low cost of MRSA, as depicted by the 2004 US$ billion estimate, is reflective of the overall high cost of AMR in the USA, as evidenced by the CDC's 2011 societal cost estimate of approximately $55 billion ($20 billion health service) per year, placing it at a lower position in the league table of disease burden for"}, {"header": "TABLE 2: COMPARATIVE ECONOMIC BURDEN", "content": "The paradoxical nature of the modest economic impact of AMR, despite acknowledged threats to health and healthcare, arises from current estimates based on incremental costs related to extra treatment of resistant infections, which are relatively rare and often isolated outbreaks, highlighting the potential future costs associated with increasing resistance and transmission, and the indirect impact on healthcare delivery in the presence of secondary infections."}, {"header": "Limits of assessing 'costs of resistance'", "content": "The 'cost-of-illness' approach fails to capture the true costs of antibiotic resistance due to its negative externalities, limited impact on consumption, and the sigmoidal pattern of resistance development, making it insufficient to address the issue effectively."}, {"header": "FIGURE 2: SIGMOIDAL DEVELOPMENT OF AMR", "content": "The critical implication is that the uncertainty surrounding current and future transmission, coupled with discounting of future benefits, makes strategies to reduce transmission more cost-effective than strategies to control emergence, reinforcing the status quo, while public and media concerns often focus on avoidable infections, leading to a cost to maintaining public confidence in healthcare providers and institutions, necessitating a comprehensive analysis of the true economic burden of Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR) for the health system, which is crucial for planning, resource allocation, and policy making today."}, {"header": "BOX 2: CASE STUDY HIPS", "content": "The potential consequences of removing antimicrobials from healthcare systems, as illustrated by the hypothetical scenario of a resurgence into the pre-antibiotic era, would result in significant healthcare costs, increased mortality and morbidity, and wide-ranging economic impacts, necessitating urgent investigation and potential system redesign."}, {"header": "Conclusion", "content": "The segment discusses the potential significant costs to healthcare and society in the future due to antimicrobial resistance, necessitating the rediscovery and management of effective antimicrobials as a scarce and nonrenewable resource, while also emphasizing the importance of balanced and responsible use in the context of other pressing issues like global warming and stewardship for the future."}, {"header": "Reducing uncertainty and increasing knowledge of full health system impacts", "content": "The segment highlights the uncertainty surrounding the future economic burden and technological changes required to mitigate the effects of antimicrobial resistance, while also emphasizing the need for better information to estimate the cost implications and assess the impact on various healthcare services, highlighting the challenges in funding and expertise collaboration in this research endeavor."}, {"header": "Developing better, more radical, incentive mechanisms", "content": "There is a need for improvements in incentive mechanisms at various levels, particularly in incentivizing the development of new antimicrobials, protecting and discouraging their use, promoting public-private partnerships, and addressing the societal costs of antimicrobial use while balancing personal costs and potential side effects, necessitating the consideration of more restrictive prescription options and possibly drawing inspiration from the environmental movement."}, {"header": "Enhancing international activity", "content": "The segment highlights the importance of addressing antimicrobial resistance through integrated UK strategies, championing at both EU and international levels, while considering the potential free-riding behavior of other countries and the influence of outside factors on anticipated research trajectories."}, {"header": "Lessons from climate change", "content": "Both global warming and antimicrobial resistance pose significant threats to human well-being, with uncertain future extents and trajectories, and require global responses, while the former's impact is less clear for resistance, illustrating the importance of clear, consistent, and simple messages from the scientific community in promoting action and individual change for addressing these issues."}, {"header": "BOX 2: CASE STUDY HIPS", "content": "The potential impact of removing antimicrobial therapies in the context of hip replacements and amputations, as a proxy for estimating the economic burden of future antibiotic resistance, is estimated to increase post-operative infection rates from 1% to 50% and deaths from 0% to 30%, leading to a decrease in hip replacement rates and increased morbidity from higher levels of pain."}, {"header": "Search Process", "content": "In the initial stage of the research, focused on antimicrobial resistance and costs, electronic database searching was conducted using generic terms and combinations from the previous review, limited to Web of Science and Medline, and specific terms included were: antimicrobial, resistance, and costs, with searches limited by titles."}, {"header": "Stage 2/4: Citation searching", "content": "During the review process, the reference lists of selected papers were scanned to identify additional papers, while review papers found through the review were utilized in citation searching at both the initial and subsequent stages"}, {"header": "Stage 3: Further electronic bibliographic database searching relating to specific terminology", "content": "In the context of limited resources, a focused search on two major current resistant infections, MRS and VRE, combined with specific micro-organism and antimicrobial terminology, identified gaps in citation lists for evidence on resistance costs, resulting in missed papers related to these infections due to insufficient search terms."}, {"header": "Inclusion criteria", "content": "The review focused on papers that provided empirical evidence on the economic impact of antimicrobial resistance, focusing on factors such as length of stay, mortality, patient cost, societal cost, and a control group of susceptible infections published since 2000 in English, while excluding studies that solely focused on infection costs, and included peer-reviewed journals as criteria, with a particular emphasis on the cost of resistance rather than infection itself, while also tracking and citing alternative control strategies for cost-effectiveness analysis."}, {"header": "Identification of papers", "content": "The initial identification and screening of papers in the stage 1 search were conducted by three reviewers, with one of them being an expert in the subject area, followed by reading and final decision on inclusion in the review after completing citation searches and database searching, resulting in the selection of additional papers."}, {"header": "Data extraction", "content": "A systematic review led to the development and utilization of standardized data extraction forms, which systematically collected data for each study"}, {"header": "Findings", "content": "The review identified 24 relevant papers, but due to insufficient resources, the total number of literature is likely underestimated, while the studies on MRSA and VRE provide valuable insights into the relevant literature, albeit partially capturing the scope of the research."}]}
