{"id": "Smith an", "name": "Smith and Coast - 2013 - The economic burden of antimicrobial resistance Why it is more serious than current studies suggest.grobid.tei.xml", "segments": [{"header": "Introduction", "content": "The development of antimicrobial resistance poses a significant challenge to healthcare in the 21st century, threatening both primary infectious diseases and secondary infections associated with healthcare and other diseases, and calls for a reevaluation of evidence-based policy and research methodologies to address this pressing issue."}, {"header": "A brief history of AMR", "content": "The segment discusses the history and potential future development of antibiotic resistance, emphasizing that while natural selection can counteract the effects of antimicrobial treatments, the rapid evolution of resistant strains may render certain antimicrobials ineffective, necessitating a consideration of the 'genetic cost' to the organism and the potential loss of effectiveness for any particular antimicrobial, highlighting the complexities of the relationship between consumption and resistance."}, {"header": "The current situation", "content": "The growing concern in response to the increased resistance of organisms to multiple therapies is due to the simultaneous reduction in new therapies entering the market, which exacerbates the issue as the natural process of resistance is accelerated, necessitating the need for alternative therapies to replace ineffective ones, mirroring the situation during the latter half of the 20th century when the antimicrobial 'armoury' was continuously being added, but at a slower rate now.<|im_end|>\nTo summarize, the escalating concern regarding the resistance of organisms to multiple therapies is a consequence of the diminishing number of new therapies entering the market, which exacerbates"}, {"header": "FIGURE 1: DRUG DISCOVERY", "content": "The segment highlights the significant decline in antimicrobial drug development by major pharmaceutical companies and the increasing resistance of pathogens like S. Aureus and E. faecium, leading to the diminishing effectiveness of these drugs and the diminishing pipeline of new antimicrobials entering clinical practice, marking a crucial turning point in the history of infectious diseases as the window of opportunity for antimicrobial therapies is rapidly closing."}, {"header": "Current activities", "content": "Progress has been made in recent years in practice and policy for more responsible and conservative use of antimicrobials, leading to better stewardship of antibiotics, informed by surveillance activities and promoting prudent use, infection control, and responsible use to curb antibiotic resistance."}, {"header": "Why these are not sufficient", "content": "Despite progress and scientific consensus on the need for action, the question remains whether interventions to reduce antimicrobial use will have a significant impact, particularly in terms of changing the inevitable loss of effective antimicrobial therapies, highlighting the challenges of widespread use, rapid transmission, and lack of new product development, and the incentives for pharmaceutical companies and policy makers to restrict use, emphasizing the need for substantial costs and cost-effectiveness to justify investment in new drugs and resistance prevention measures."}, {"header": "Evidence on current economic burden", "content": "Treatment failure due to AMR contributes to increased costs of care, encompassing additional investigations, alternative treatments, side effects, longer hospital stays, reduced productivity, and a higher likelihood of death, while quantitatively, the burden varies depending on the assessment level, cost components, and disease focus, potentially leading to diverse figures and a range of costs associated with AMR treatment failure."}, {"header": "Updated literature review", "content": "This updated systematic literature review focuses on the economic burden of resistance in English-language, peer-reviewed journals published since 2000, considering factors such as length of stay, mortality, patient cost, and societal cost related to AMR, while excluding cost-effectiveness analyses of alternative control strategies."}, {"header": "TABLE 1 SUMMARY OF COST DATA", "content": "The studies in Table 1, despite varying costs and originating predominantly in the USA, consistently indicate a substantial range of additional costs per patient per episode for hospital costs, with societal costs potentially reaching \u00a310 billion per year, largely driven by productivity losses, and revealing a significant underestimation of costs due to hospital-based studies and limited application of macro-economic modeling techniques, highlighting the limited evidence base concerning the economic burden of AMR."}, {"header": "The case of MRSA", "content": "The segment discusses a case study comparing MRSA and MSSA resistance, highlighting the significant variation in costs across treatments, with modest costs at higher ends, and noting the availability of therapy for MRSA, unlike some other emerging resistant gram negatives."}, {"header": "BOX 1: A CASE STUDY OF MRSA", "content": "The relatively low cost for MRSA, in conjunction with AMR in general, highlights"}, {"header": "TABLE 2: COMPARATIVE ECONOMIC BURDEN", "content": "The modest economic impact of AMR, despite acknowledged threats to health and healthcare, is primarily linked to the incremental costs of treating resistance in primary infections, with potentially more significant indirect consequences on healthcare delivery in the future, despite current estimates primarily focusing on resistance itself and its incremental costs."}, {"header": "Limits of assessing 'costs of resistance'", "content": "The 'cost-of-illness' approach fails to accurately represent the true costs of Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR) due to its focus on direct medical costs and the minuscule, discounted externality effect of antimicrobial consumption, as well as the specific sigmoidal pattern of resistance development, as exemplified by the figur"}, {"header": "FIGURE 2: SIGMOIDAL DEVELOPMENT OF AMR", "content": "The current and future uncertainty regarding transmission, coupled with discounting of future benefits, makes strategies to reduce transmission more cost-effective than controlling emergence, reinforcing the status quo, while also highlighting the cost to maintaining public confidence in healthcare institutions, as the'real' costs of antibiotic resistance involve the loss of essential treatment possibilities throughout life, particularly for newborn babies suffering from MDR bacteria."}, {"header": "BOX 2: CASE STUDY HIPS", "content": "The potential true cost of AMR, as depicted by the return to the pre-antibiotic era, is a catastrophic blow to healthcare system development, necessitating significant redesign of facilities, reintroduction of sanatoria, and substantial economic impacts, including workforce strain and increased healthcare costs."}, {"header": "Conclusion", "content": "The segment discusses the potential significant costs to healthcare and society as antimicrobial resistance (AMR) becomes more prevalent due to the increasing ineffectiveness of modern antimicrobial therapies, necessitating the rediscovery of effective antimicrobials as a scarce and nonrenewable resource, necessitating a balanced assessment of their optimal use over time, and highlighting the need for stewardship in addressing these challenges, which arise from the three aspects of prevention, including AMR, global warming, and the importance of balancing current burdens and costs with the long-term benefits of stewardship."}, {"header": "Reducing uncertainty and increasing knowledge of full health system impacts", "content": "The segment highlights the uncertainty surrounding the future economic burden and technological changes required to mitigate the effects of antimicrobial resistance, while also emphasizing the need for better information to estimate the cost implications and assess the impact on various healthcare services, highlighting the challenges in funding and expertise collaboration in this research endeavor."}, {"header": "Developing better, more radical, incentive mechanisms", "content": "To address the challenges in incentivizing the development and responsible use of antimicrobials, improvements are needed at various levels, including strengthening protection and discouragement of new therapies, promoting public-private partnerships, pre-purchase agreements, or direct public funding, while balancing personal costs with societal benefits, and considering the acceptability of such restrictions in the context of robust research."}, {"header": "Enhancing international activity", "content": "The segment discusses the global issue of antimicrobial resistance, highlighting the importance of international collaboration for developing new drugs and diagnostics to combat multi-resistant bacteria, while also emphasizing the need for understanding resistance mechanisms, cost considerations, and strategies to control resistance without relying solely on new drug developments, and acknowledges the challenges of championing this issue in the UK while considering potential free-riding behavior from other countries and the influence of outside factors on anticipated research trajectories."}, {"header": "Lessons from climate change", "content": "Both antimicrobial resistance and climate change pose significant threats to human well-being, but inertia and personal incentives hinder progress in addressing them, with global warming receiving greater scientific consensus and public support, while MRSA's resistance presents a clear danger of impending apocalyptic scenarios; however, climate change has moved into the mainstream of activities, while MRSA's economic burden is substantial, illustrated by table 1."}, {"header": "BOX 2: CASE STUDY HIPS", "content": "The potential impact of removing antimicrobial therapies in the context of surgeries such as hip replacements, amputations, and hip replacements without antibiotics is estimated through analyzing the flow of patients, infection rates, and treatment outcomes, suggesting that approximately 99% of patients exit at 15-18 days post-surgery, with a 40-50% rate of post-operative infection, and 30% of those infected dying, highlighting the need for comprehensive analysis to estimate the true economic burden of future antimicrobial resistance."}, {"header": "Search Process", "content": "In the initial stage of the research, electronic database searching focused on generic terms related to antimicrobial resistance, costs, and limited resources, utilizing key terms from the previous review, with searches limited to Web of Science and Medline, focusing on titles and including specific terms such as antimicrobial, resistance, and costs."}, {"header": "Stage 2/4: Citation searching", "content": "During the review process, the selected papers' reference lists were scanned for additional papers, while the review papers themselves were utilized for citation-based searching at both initial and subsequent stages of the search"}, {"header": "Stage 3: Further electronic bibliographic database searching relating to specific terminology", "content": "Efforts to identify relevant empirical papers and review papers on the costs of resistance in relation to specific micro-organisms, particularly MRSA and VRE, were hindered by the absence of specific terminology and antimicrobials, necessitating a focused search on two of the most studied resistant infections, while considering limited resources and combining economic terms."}, {"header": "Inclusion criteria", "content": "The review focused on papers that provided empirical evidence on the economic impact of antimicrobial resistance, focusing on primary data collection for either type of evidence, including length of stay, mortality, patient cost, and societal cost, while including a control group of susceptible infections, published since 2000 in English, and from peer-reviewed journals, while excluding review papers and studies without quality criteria."}, {"header": "Identification of papers", "content": "In the initial stage of a systematic literature review, papers are
