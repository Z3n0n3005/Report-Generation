      "content": "The primordial mass of the Mab (massive asteroid belt) was severely depleted, leading to a violent giant planet dynamical instability that could result in about 99.9% depletion, with depletion timescales of 5-10 Myr after gas disk dispersal, and the primordial mass being partially or fully devoid of material initially, as supported by cosmochemical evidence and alternative models like ring-structured protoplanetary disks and pebble accretion, with ideal scenarios accounting for both collisional and dynamical evolution in a self-consistent way. The primordial mass of the Mab cannot exceed the limit for accretion to form too many s-complex objects with d > 500 km, as suggested by the findings of the presented study."

      "content": "The study acknowledges that the primordial Mab SFD may vary depending on initial sfd and disruption laws, and the exact time and radial distance of Jupiter's formation remain unknown, while considering various scenarios during the gas disk phase and incorporating planetesimal accretion, without knowing the exact time it takes for Jupiter and Saturn to be captured in mutual MMRs and develop significant eccentricities, using a tracer particle code like Lipad that simulates the accretion of objects within the MAB region over a 5 Myr period, allowing for self-gravitational interactions and collisional evolution of planetesimals, while discarding objects below 1 mm in size."

      "content": "After accounting for accretion during the initial 5 Myr of the solar system's history, the subsequent 4.5 Gyr evolution after gas disk dispersal necessitates considering the processes that occurred during the subsequent 4.5 Gyr after dispersing the gas disk, while avoiding overlaps with the Hilda population, and selecting objects from the Minor Planet Center (MPC) database with semi-major axes less than 4.1 au and distances greater than 50 km, to ensure accurate comparison with the core of the asteroid belt (AB) object Mab, which is defined by an inclination cutoff of 20 degrees, and subsequently using this AB definition to select objects with H values less than 9.6, corresponding to objects with diameters greater than 50 km, while minimizing contamination from main belt fragments resulting from catastrophic collisions."

    {
      "header": "RESULTS",
      "content": "Considering the potential limitations of depletion due to giant planet instability and accounting for size and semi-major axis dependency, the overall evolved S-type components of evolved Solar FDs (SFDs) are unlikely to significantly change, as long as the population of late-formed S-type asteroids is not overwhelmingly large and forms with a cumulative SFD power slope in the range 100 km < d < 500 km similar to the primordial population of planetesimals at 0.5 myr, provided that the depletion occurs anytime within 100 myr after gas disk dispersal and collisional timescales are not significantly longer than 8 years."

      "header": "CONCLUSIONS",
      "content": "The objective of the study was to determine the maximum possible total mass of primordial MAB objects, considering depletion due to chaotic diffusion, and to assess the implications of larger primordial MAB masses on the formation of S-complex asteroids and the number of objects larger than 500 km, with a focus on the CMB and OMB regions, which yielded survival factors lower than any other sub-region, making the results incompatible with observations for the only S-complex object with a diameter greater than 500 km (4 Vesta) residing in the MAB region."
