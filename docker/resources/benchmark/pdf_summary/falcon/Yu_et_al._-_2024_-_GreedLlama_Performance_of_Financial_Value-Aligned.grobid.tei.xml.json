operations prompts a critical examination of value alignment, especially as companies begin to leverage these models for automating decision processes . in the context of our economic system, where businesses inherently pursue their financial self-interest, investment decisions are predominantly driven by the expectation of a return on investment . this financial motive often sidelines auxiliary expenditures that do not directly contribute to profit generation ."}, {"header": "Related Works", "content": "d of applying large language models (llms) in various sectors, including finance and
