In addition, metapopulation models generally assume that communities are connected to each other in the same way, with few exceptions to this The framework introduced in its general form in section 3.1, we derive general analytical methods for the dynamics in this limit ."

      "content":  "The general framework introduced in A population is composed of N individuals I n = I 1 , ..., I N . Individuals are positioned on a spatial network with M places P m = P 1 . The position of each individual is independent both of where they were previously and of where other individuals will be where h is the home fidelity parameter . We further introduce w, the intensity of selection as defined in the literature ."

      "content":  "In section 3.1, we describe the evolutionary process arising from this limit across the six introduced dynamics and derive exact expressions for single mutant fixation probabilities under any network of communities . We further analyze these contributions under the general social dilemma section, which is complemented by the content in appendix B . In this section, we analyze the extent to which these rules are valid outside of the limits of large networks ."

      "content":  "In this context, we show that whether a strategy evolves or not depends on the advantage it holds against other strategies in two contexts: when in homogeneous groups and when in within-community fixation processes . In the context of the HD dilemma, we find that a conflict between cooperating as a socially best strategy, i.e. a Pareto optimal one, and defecting as an individually best strategy . This is in line with what is observed in alternative community and deme models ."
