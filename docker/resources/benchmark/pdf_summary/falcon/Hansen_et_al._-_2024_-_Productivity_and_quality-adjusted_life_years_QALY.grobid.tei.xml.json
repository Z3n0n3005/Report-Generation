The affine PALY evaluation function (3).satisfies COMMON, HI, TIFHCP, PIFHCT, and TIUP .The first distribution (d  ), all individuals are experiencing full health and forty years of lifetime (until retirement, or the end of life) The third individual is experiencing 50% of maximum productivity and a forty-year"

      "content":  "Theorem 5 implies that a social planner chooses an evaluation function like the PQALY where health status and productivity of individuals enter the evaluation function multiplicatively . The second value specifies that if an intervention leads to extra life years, it does not matter which particular individual (among individuals with the same level of health and productivity) receives these additional life years (axiom TICHP) The previous family of evaluation functions ( QALY-PALY ) includes a natural sub-family of evaluation function ("

      "content":  "The data collection of the economic evaluation will typically involve capturing information on all individuals in the intervention and control group . Instead of making that choice directly based on their functional forms, we rather believe the choice should be guided by the axioms they satisfy . In particular, each respondent would be asked to identify the number of individuals x in Intervention B to be indifferent between both interventions . Once y is identified, it follows from evaluation function the need for using a more flexible evaluation function (for example the QALY"

To wit, we made no assumptions regarding the domain of health states A (except for the existence of a maximum element)"
