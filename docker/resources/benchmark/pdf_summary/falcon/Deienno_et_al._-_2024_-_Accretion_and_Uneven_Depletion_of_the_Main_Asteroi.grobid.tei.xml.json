      "content":  "The main asteroid belt (MAB) contains over 1 million objects with diameter D larger than 1 km . On one side, it was proposed that solids in the protoplanetary disk followed a smooth radial distribution of mass Early depletion of the MAB could happen in the following ways . It is clear from the discussion presented in the previous paragraphs that the primordial MAB was partially or fully devoid of material initially ."

      "content":  "We followed the accretion of objects within our MAB region for 5 Myr . This interval is presumably the time the gas in the solar nebula dispersed in the outer solar system based on the relative age of the youngest CB-chondrites to CAIs . We discarded objects that collisionally evolved to sizes below 1 mm, assuming those would rapidly grind down to dust ."

      "content":  "The work by Our analyses clearly demonstrate that MAB depletion during the giant planet instability is not uniform . In this work, we consider the MAB region to be delimited as follows . We then use this MAB definition to select objects from the Minor Planet Center (MPC) database ."

      "content":  "The current cumulative MAB SFD presents a very characteristic power slope in the 100 km  D  500 km range . In Figure The fact that our evolved SFDs preserve the primordial power law slope of the cumulative distribution for objects with 100 km-D 500 km indicates our simulations are compatible with the finds by As observed in Figure It is important to account for the semi-major axis dependency of depletion when attempting to glean insights into the nature of the primordial MAB from the current MAB"

      "header": "CONCLUSIONS",
      "content":  "The current MAB total mass is tiny (510 -4 M  ; DeMeo & Carry 2014) There is a debate in the literature on whether such a small MAB mass was primordial . We assumed different values of total mass for our primordial MAB (see Section 2 for a detailed description of model parameters) We also attributed a SFD for the MAB primordial population ."
