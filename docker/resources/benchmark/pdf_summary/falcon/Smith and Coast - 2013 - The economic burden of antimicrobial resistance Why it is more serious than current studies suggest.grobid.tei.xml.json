      "content":  "The ability of organisms to develop resistance to the effects of antimicrobial therapies developed to kill them is potentially the greatest challenge to healthcare in the 21st century . It increases the threat of primary infectious diseases such as tuberculosis, but also secondary infections associated both with other diseases and the provision of healthcare itself . The paper highlights the critical problem with the current emphasis on using economic burden as evidence for directing future investment in health issues ."

This apparent inconsistency might arise because current estimates of the cost of AMR are based loosely on the 'incremental' cost related to the extra treatment of resistant over (actual or assumed) susceptible infection .

This requires an assessment of the balance between the positive effects of using anti-microbial therapies now, and the negative impact of this use on their temporal effectiveness .
