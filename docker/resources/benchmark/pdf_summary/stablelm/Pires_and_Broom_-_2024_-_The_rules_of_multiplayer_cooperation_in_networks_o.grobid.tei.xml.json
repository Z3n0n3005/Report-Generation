The analysis also reveals that the dbb and bdd dynamics amplify between-community replacement events and suppress within-community selection, leading to a condition \u03c1 c > \u03c1 d, and provides a closed-form expression for the fixation probability of a single mutant under these dynamics. The analysis is substantiated by the work in Appendix A and B, and the results are contextualized in the context of high home fidelity, weak selection, and large networks of communities in Section 3.3."}, {"header": "Discussion", "content": "In the context of community-structured populations, the territorial raider model, which is a fully independent movement model with high home fidelity, reveals a nested Moran process resembling metapopulation models, where migration and selection are coupled, asymptotically rare as it is considered in, and can be derived from basic evolutionary graph theory assumptions without considering between-community events of a different nature. The dynamics depend on the reward-to-cost ratio, the number and size of communities, and the reward production function, with cooperation evolving under all social dilemmas for any given number of communities, as long as there are at least two, they are large enough to produce rewards, and the rewards are high enough in public goods dilemmas or low enough in the hd dilemma (a commons dilemma focused on the fair consumption of preexisting resources)."}]}
