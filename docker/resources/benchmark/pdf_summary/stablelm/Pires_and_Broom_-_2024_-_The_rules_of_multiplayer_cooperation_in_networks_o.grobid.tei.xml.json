Social dilemmas can be divided into three categories: non-threshold, threshold, and threshold-like. Non-threshold dilemmas allow cooperation to evolve for any community size if the reward-to-cost ratio V/K surpasses a critical value, which is independent of the community size. Threshold dilemmas have a critical value of the reward-to-cost ratio, above which cooperation evolves, only if the size of communities is at least of the same size as the public goods production threshold (Q \u2265 L). Threshold-like dilemmas have a critical value of the reward-to-cost ratio, above which cooperation evolves, only if the size of communities is at least of the same size as the public goods production threshold (Q \u2265 L). Under threshold dilemmas, cooperation can never evolve if the size of communities is smaller than the public goods production threshold (Q \u2264 L). The HD dilemma, which is a commons dilemma, has a reward-to-cost ratio lower than the critical value for cooperation to evolve. The critical value of the reward-to-cost ratio increases with the size of communities and the used evolutionary dynamics. Increasing the size of communities leads to stricter conditions for the evolution of cooperation. The impact of between-community reproduction and within-community fixation decreases with community size under the BDB/BDD dynamics, while under the DBB/BDD dynamics, both effects interplay and each dominates at a different scale of community sizes. The rules obtained under the CPD are parallel not only to the clique structures explored in At the same time, when interacting via the CPD, cooperators can never evolve if the evolutionary dynamics considered are the BDB/DBD/LB/LD dynamics, as shown in appendix A.2 for arbitrary values of intensity of selection and number of communities."}, {"header": "Discussion", "content": "In the limit of high home fidelity, the probability of within-community fixation in multiplayer social dilemmas depends on the advantage held by the strategies in two contexts: when in homogeneous communities and when in within-community fixation processes. Consistently, the probability of within-community fixation for cooperators is higher than that for defectors, and the within-community fixation probability for a single cooperator in a community of defectors is given by the ratio between the fitness of cooperators and the total population size divided by the reward-to-cost ratio. The probability of the size of a community increasing by one in the next evolutionary step depends on the transition probabilities under the territorial raider model, which are independent of the community topology and depend only on the within-community fixation probabilities and the probability ratio \u0393. The difference in transition probabilities affects the probability that the number of communities increases or decreases by one in the next evolutionary step, with the DBB dynamics exhibiting a higher probability of within-community fixation and the BDD dynamics exhibiting a higher probability of between-community replacements. The transition probabilities under the DBB and BDD dynamics are independent of the particular set of edges between the nodes of the network, but only the time-scale at which these transitions occur. The limit of weak selection and the limit of large population size do not impact the resulting asymptotic fixation probability expansions and the conditions for the evolution of a given strategy to be favored in comparison to neutral fixation. The limit of weak selection introduces corrections to the effective fitness, and the limit of large population size affects the transition probabilities and the derivatives of the effective fitness. The critical value of the reward-to-cost ratio for cooperation to fixate in public goods dilemmas depends on the intensity of selection and the number of communities, with larger community sizes requiring higher reward-to-cost ratios for cooperators to successfully fixate."}]}
