This is addressed through the implementation of the 'karma' mechanism, which mirrors the western popular culture concept of karma and samsara from Indian religions, where one's deeds in the present affect the quality of one's future life. The mechanism is implemented via individual accounts of non-tradable credits called karma, where individuals bid some amount from their current account at every instance of resource allocation, with the highest bidders winning, obtaining priority for the resource, paying their bids, which are then transferred to the accounts of those who did not win. This mechanism has been previously used in non-human contexts to manage scarcity in areas such as traffic, transportation, cloud computing, and peer-to-peer networks, and has been found to result in significant aggregate gains in terms of food bank participation and fluidity of donations. In this paper, a controlled test of the mechanism's behavioral uptake and distributional consequences is conducted, finding substantial efficiency gains that benefit almost all participants, with benefits particularly pronounced in situations when preference intensities are dynamically more intense and less frequent, and the bidding scheme is designed to be minimal (binary). Further theoretical and experimental investigation is needed to further explore the potential of this mechanism in human interactions."}, {"header": "EXPERIMENTAL METHODS", "content": "The study conducted a balanced two-by-two factorial experiment with 400 subjects, varying the dynamic urgency process and richness of the karma scheme in a game where participants bid over a shared resource, with payments and redistribution based on the observed outcomes and a maximum karma level, aiming to investigate behavioral effects and efficiency differences between the binary and full range schemes."}, {"header": "RESULTS", "content": "The study finds that there are significant efficiency gains across all treatments, with the highest gains observed in the high stake process, and the distribution of efficiency gains is more favorable in the binary bidding scheme compared to the full range bidding scheme, with over 90% of the population benefiting from the Karma allocation. Simple turn-taking schemes can also improve the efficiency gains and fairness of the Karma allocation."}, {"header": "DISCUSSION", "content": "The study concludes that the aggregate efficiency gains of a karma scheme, compared to random allocation, are statistically significant and beneficial in all treatments, with the exception of the lowest decile of non-adopters. The experiments provide the first formal evidence for the potential social benefits of using a karma scheme with human participants, improving efficiency for almost everyone, and suggest that a simpler binary scheme may be more efficient than a richer scheme for certain applications. The analysis also highlights the importance of training and commitment in maximizing the benefits of the scheme."}]}
