The concept of urgency is introduced to capture the notion that one person relative to another may have higher utility from a good in one period but lower utility in another. A recent innovation called karma addresses these allocation problems by implementing individual accounts of non-tradable credits called karma, which mirrors the western popular culture concept of karma and Indian religions' samsara. The mechanism is designed to mirror a closed economy, with individuals transferring karma among each other to preserve the karma per capita over time. The study found that compared to random allocation, the implementation of karma leads to substantial efficiency gains, benefiting almost all participants, with benefits being particularly pronounced in situations when preference intensities are dynamically more intense and less frequent, and the bidding scheme is designed to be minimal (binary)."}, {"header": "EXPERIMENTAL METHODS", "content": "The study conducted a balanced two-by-two factorial experiment with 400 subjects, varying the dynamic urgency process and richness of the karma scheme in a game where participants bid over a shared resource, with payments and redistribution based on the observed outcomes and a maximum karma level, aiming to investigate behavioral effects and efficiency differences between the binary and full range schemes."}, {"header": "RESULTS", "content": "The study finds that there are significant efficiency gains across all treatments, with the highest gains observed in the high stake process, and the distribution of efficiency gains is more favorable in the binary bidding scheme compared to the full range bidding scheme, with over 90% of the population benefiting from the Karma allocation. Simple turn-taking schemes can also improve the efficiency gains and fairness of the Karma allocation."}, {"header": "DISCUSSION", "content": "The study concludes that the aggregate efficiency gains of a karma scheme, compared to random allocation, are statistically significant and beneficial in all treatments, with the exception of the lowest decile of non-adopters. The experiments provide the first formal evidence for the potential social benefits of using a karma scheme with human participants, improving efficiency for almost everyone, and suggest that a simpler binary scheme may be sufficient for certain applications. The analysis also highlights the importance of training and commitment in maximizing efficiency gains."}]}
