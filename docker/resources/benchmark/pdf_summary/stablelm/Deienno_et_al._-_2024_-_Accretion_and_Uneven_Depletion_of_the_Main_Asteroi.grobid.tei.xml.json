The s-and c-complex asteroid taxonomic groups, which can be characterized as dry and potentially carrying water by mass, formed in regions interior and exterior to the orbit of Jupiter and were transported into the MAB at later stages after their formation, with the primordial mass of the MAB determining the formation and early evolution of the solar system."}, {"header": "MODEL", "content": "The study models the evolution of the MAB SFD and planetesimal accretion in the MAB region by assuming a primordial MAB SFD between 100 km and 500 km, starting at 500 K years after the formation of calcium-aluminum-inclusions, considering the collisional and accretional dynamics of a large number of subkilometer-sized objects using the Lagrangian integrator code Lipad, which reproduces the observed MAB SFD for objects with sizes between 100 km and 500 km, accounting for gas disk dispersal effects and considering the perturbations of Jupiter and Saturn in the simulations."}, {"header": "MAB, DATASET, AND COMPARISON WITH MPC", "content": "After accounting for the depletion effects of the giant planet instability and subsequent 4.5 gyr evolution, the mab is found to be heavily depleted, with a depletion factor ranging from 75% to 99.9%, depending on the defined mab region and the specific orbital constraints satisfied by the simulations. The depletion analysis is further divided into five sub-regions, with the mab being depleted by the number of planet-planet close encounters and the specific orbital evolution of the giant planets during the giant planet instability. The depletion factor is highly dependent on the definition of the mab region, with some studies reporting a depletion of approximately 95.45% (as in the work by Clement et al., 2019) and others reporting a depletion of 99.9% (as in the work by ). The methodology applied by Clement et al. (2019) is considered valid, but it remains to be confirmed that giant planet instabilities leading up to 99.9% depletion of the mab are consistent with other solar system constraints, including jupiter's eccentricity and the period ratio of Jupiter and Saturn (p s /p j)."}, {"header": "RESULTS", "content": "The study aims to evaluate the evolution and depletion of MAB SFDs, as well as the number of 4-Vesta-like objects within the core of MAB, across its five sub-regions (Eimb, Imb, Cmb, Omb, and Eomb), while considering the influence of Jupiter's gravitational perturbation. Simulations show that evolved SFDs preserve the primordial power law slope for objects with 100 km < d < 500 km, and the depletion factors are uneven across all sub-regions. The comparison between the current MAB SFDs and the assumed s-complex SFDs, accounting for size and depletion size-dependency, is valid and correct, with the overall evolved SFDs not changing under reasonable assumptions. The depletion factors' unevenness across sub-regions makes estimating the maximum primordial MAB mass at 0.5 myr after cais challenging."}, {"header": "CONCLUSIONS", "content": "The primary objective of the study was to determine the maximum possible total mass that could have existed in the primordial MAB region, which yielded that the maximum primordial MAB mass at around 0.5 Myr was likely to be smaller than approximately 2.14\u00d710^-3 M\u2295, leading to inconsistencies with the current inferred s-complex asteroid sfd and the formation of too many s-complex objects with diameters greater than 500 km."}]}
