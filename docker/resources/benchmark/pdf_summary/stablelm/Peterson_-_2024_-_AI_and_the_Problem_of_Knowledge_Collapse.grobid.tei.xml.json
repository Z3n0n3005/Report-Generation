It proposes a knowledge spillovers model where individuals choose between relying on cheaper AI technology or investing in samples from the full distribution of true knowledge. The study evaluates the conditions under which individuals can prevent knowledge collapse within society through simulations and concludes with possible solutions to mitigate the risk of knowledge collapse in the AI era."}, {"header": "Related Work", "content": "The segment discusses how technology, particularly digital platforms and social interactions, have raised concerns about the impact on knowledge transmission and creation, with examples from ancient times, and explores the effects of recommendation algorithms, self-selection, and information cascades on distorted and polarizing opinions, while also highlighting the potential issues with AI-generated knowledge and biases."}, {"header": "The media, filter bubbles and echo chambers", "content": "The critique of social media is that they facilitate echo chambers, leading to exposure to narrow perspectives and reinforcing pre-existing beliefs, potentially resulting in political polarization, while technological constraints and dynamics beyond homophily within network growth models may contribute to this phenomenon, as exemplified by filter bubbles, popularity bias, and information cascades."}, {"header": "Network effects and Information Cascades", "content": "Information cascade models explain herd behavior by examining conditions under which private information is not efficiently aggregated by the public, leading to a \"herd externality\" where individuals ignore their private signal in decision-making, resulting in the public unable to update on their private information, and the potential for information cascades; these models consider network structure, diffusion probabilities, social influence, and other network characteristics to analyze the spread of information in social networks, with variations that address free-riding tendencies and the emergence of opinion dynamics in evolving networks."}, {"header": "Model collapse", "content": "The concept of model collapse is rooted in the phenomenon of mode collapse in generative adversarial networks (GANs), where the generator network may produce a narrow range of images due to statistical error or functional approximation error, leading to reversion to the mean and late model collapse, while incorporating AI-generated content in training data can lead to loss of information, causing early and late model collapse, diminishing lexical, semantic, and syntactic diversity, as demonstrated in various models including LLMs and VAEs."}, {"header": "Known biases in LLMs", "content": "Newer AI models, such as LLMs, face challenges in accurately capturing long-tail knowledge and maintaining diverse perspectives, while also exhibiting biases in their output, particularly in generating human-like texts, which can be addressed through upsampling, shapely value evaluation, and interpretability techniques, but may still exhibit less observable biases in content and form of the output, relying on English in their latent representations, and potentially creating degenerate repetitive phrases through beam search in decoding strategies; similar to the way humans surprise the listener with low-probability words in their speech."}, {"header": "A Model of Knowledge Collapse Defining Knowledge Collapse", "content": "The optimistic view that knowledge has improved monotonically over time, particularly in scientific fields, is not universally applicable, as evidenced by instances of knowledge loss or decline, such as the Western Roman Empire, the House of Wisdom in Baghdad, and the collapse of the Mayan civilization, as well as varying knowledge distribution and specialization across individuals, which can impact beliefs, scientific judgments, and the usefulness of information."}, {"header": "Model Overview", "content": "The model explores the dynamics of individuals deciding between investing in innovation or learning through AI-enabled processes, considering the potential for rational agents to prevent or correct for over-dependence on 'centrist' information. It examines the conditions under which updating among individuals is sufficient to preserve an accurate vision of the truth for the community as a whole, and how the cost-benefit decision depends on the expected value of the information, individual types, and the distribution of knowledge. The model also considers the impact of generational turnover and the possibility of information cascades, where individuals rely on the knowledge of previous generations and assume that valuable knowledge is present in the 'tail' regions."}, {"header": "Results", "content": "The segment discusses the potential consequences of AI's reduced cost of accessing information, particularly in terms of knowledge dissemination and preservation, and how strategic humans may seek out the input data that maintains a comprehensive distribution of knowledge, considering various discount rates and parameters, ultimately highlighting the tradeoff between the availability of cheap AI-approximations and the distance of public knowledge from the truth, illustrating the impact of learning rates, truncation of AI-generated content, and generational compounding on knowledge collapse."}, {"header": "Discussion", "content": "The theoretical framework proposed in this segment suggests that relying on generative AI like large language models may lead to knowledge collapse due to a reduction in long-tail knowledge, necessitating measures to manage AI adoption, such as diversifying AI-generated content, avoiding recursively dependent systems, and preserving access to unmediated texts, while also addressing the representativeness and biases of AI-generated answers in educational settings."}, {"header": "Appendix Comparing width of the tails", "content": "The segment discusses how the reported results, using a T-distribution with 10 degrees of freedom, exhibit wider tails compared to a standard normal distribution, leading to more pronounced knowledge collapse effects for extreme values, but less influence on the overall dynamic of collapse, as determined by other parameters, particularly those related to the tails, rather than the standard normal distribution itself."}, {"header": "Defining knowledge collapse", "content": "Knowledge collapse refers to the progressive narrowing of human working knowledge and the current human epistemic horizon relative to the set of broad historical knowledge, as a result of technological innovations, historical and current sources of knowledge, and the influence of human memory and habits of thought, ultimately leading to a loss of generational knowledge and potentially limiting the value of tail knowledge."}]}
