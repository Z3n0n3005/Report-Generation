{"id": "Peterson", "name": "Peterson_-_2024_-_AI_and_the_Problem_of_Knowledge_Collapse.grobid.tei.xml", "segments": [{"header": "Introduction", "content": "The development of large language models, along with image, audio, and video generation capabilities, raises concerns about the potential domination of AI-generated or AI-aided processes in shaping human exposure to data, leading to potential harms such as \"model collapse,\" \"curse of recursion,\" and the \"streetlight effect,\" which could impact fairness, innovation, and cultural preservation, while human strategic curation may mitigate these effects to some extent."}, {"header": "Summary of Main Contributions", "content": "The segment discusses a potential issue with AI, known as \"knowledge collapse,\" which may occur due to AI's reduced cost of access to information, potentially neglecting the long-tails of knowledge and creating a narrow perspective over generations, and proposes a knowledge spillovers model that considers individuals' decision to rely on cheaper AI technology or invest in samples from the full distribution of true knowledge, while also examining conditions under which individuals can prevent knowledge collapse and discussing possible solutions to mitigate this issue in the AI era."}, {"header": "Related Work", "content": "The segment discusses how technology, particularly the rise of digital platforms and social media, has influenced knowledge transmission and creation, raising concerns about its impact on scholarship and the repetition of errors, while also highlighting recent research on the role of recommendation algorithms, self-selection, information cascades, and generative AI algorithms, and their potential to generate distorted and polarizing opinions, as well as addressing the issue of model collapse and biases in AI outputs."}, {"header": "The media, filter bubbles and echo chambers", "content": "The critique of social media is that they foster \"echo chambers\" where users are exposed to selectively curated content, reinforcing pre-existing beliefs, leading to ideological polarization and the phenomenon of \"filter bubbles\" due to popularity bias in recommendation systems; this dynamic differs from traditional media, which may adapt to diverse preferences and interests; the internet's ability to provide access to long-tail products and services also contributes to this phenomenon."}, {"header": "Network effects and Information Cascades", "content": "Information cascade models reveal how herd behavior can occur when diverse individuals make similar decisions, but private information is not efficiently aggregated due to sequential decision-making without observing others' private signals, leading to a \"herd externality\" and the analysis of information flow within social networks, considering network structure, preferences, and topics, with implications for LLMs and knowledge graphs in Web 2.0."}, {"header": "Model collapse", "content": "The concept of model collapse in generative adversarial networks (GANs) is rooted in the occurrence of \"mode collapse,\" wherein the generator neural network in GANs may consistently produce a limited range of images that excel at deceiving the discriminator, leading to the breakdown of the network's ability to generate diverse and realistic outputs."}, {"header": "Known biases in LLMs", "content": "Newer AI models like LLMs face challenges due to bias, and researchers are addressing these issues by improving underrepresented features and analyzing diversity at the token-by-token level, particularly in decoding strategies, to prevent degenerate repetitive phrases in certain contexts."}, {"header": "A Model of Knowledge Collapse Defining Knowledge Collapse", "content": "The optimistic view that knowledge has improved monotonically over time, particularly in scientific fields, is supported by empirical evidence, while in other domains, historical trends and distribution of knowledge across individuals present a more complex picture, highlighting the potential for both efficiency and challenges in knowledge acquisition and application."}, {"header": "Model Overview", "content": "The model explores the decision-making process of individuals investing in innovation or learning, considering the potential benefits and costs of both AI-enabled and traditional methods, and how rational agents can prevent or correct for over-dependence on 'centrist' information, while also considering the impact of knowledge spillovers on the public knowledge distribution and the generational perspective of AI systems."}, {"header": "Results", "content": "The segment discusses the potential benefits of AI in providing access to information, but also highlights the possibility of strategic humans seeking to maintain the full distribution of knowledge by selectively utilizing certain data, considering factors such as discount rates and the tradeoff between updating on relative samples and the discount factor, ultimately emphasizing the potential for maintaining a diverse knowledge base despite AI's cost reduction."}, {"header": "Discussion", "content": "The theoretical framework proposed outlines the potential knowledge collapse resulting from excessive reliance on generative AI like large language models, emphasizing the importance of diversifying AI-generated content, preventing recursive dependency, and ensuring AI systems' representativeness to minimize harm, with practical implications for managing AI adoption, including safeguards, maintaining human engagement, and addressing representativeness issues in AI-generated responses to complex questions."}, {"header": "Appendix Comparing width of the tails", "content": "The segment discusses the comparison of results obtained from a Student's t-distribution with 10 degrees of freedom, which exhibits wider tails than a standard normal distribution, and how these results can be compared to a standard normal distribution or wider tails when the degrees of freedom increase,"}, {"header": "Defining knowledge collapse", "content": "Knowledge collapse occurs when the set of human working knowledge and the current human epistemic horizon become increasingly narrow and restrictive in comparison to the broader scope of historical knowledge, due to technological advancements and the influence of historical and current sources of knowledge, leading to a progressive narrowing of the available knowledge and the long-tails of human knowledge."}]}
