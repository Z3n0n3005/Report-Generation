      "header": "Introduction",
      "content": "The paper aims to develop a unified framework for measuring and valuing outcomes of health care interventions, occupational health and safety policies, focusing on the measurement of health benefits in terms of both quality of life and quantity of life, with a focus on considering productivity consequences, and proposes axiomatic foundations for evaluating outcomes in a population, encompassing both quality-of-life and productivity concerns, allowing for compromises among the quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and productivity-adjusted life years (PALys) measures within a unified framework."

    {
      "header": "Preliminaries",
      "content": "The segment discusses the concept of evaluating distributions of individual profiles in a population, focusing on two hypothetical distributions (d \u2206 and d \u03bb), and presents a set of seven axioms that form the basis for social preferences in this context. These axioms cover principles such as anonymity, separability, continuity, social zero condition, lifetime monotonicity at full health and productivity, unweighted aggregation of individual qalys, productivity independence, and time invariance at common health and full productivity. The segment concludes with a theorem that characterizes the qaly evaluation function and its implications for a social planner evaluating interventions, emphasizing the importance of considering productivity changes and the value of extending life for individuals with common health and maximum productivity."

    {
      "header": "Compromising between QALYs and PALYs",
      "content": "The segment discusses the evaluation functions that ignore the dimension of productivity or health, focusing on natural compromises between them while addressing the limitations of the existing axioms, specifically focusing on time invariance and productivity invariance at common health and time, and characterizing the productivity-and-quality-adjusted life years (pqaly) evaluation function as an example."

    {
      "header": "satisfies COMMON, TICHP, PICHT, and TIUP.",
      "content": "The social planner evaluates distributions using the QALY-PQaly (Qaly-PQaly) function, which divides the evaluation into two tasks: valuing pure health effects and productivity-adjusted lifespans. This function considers both health effects and productivity effects as important outcomes of interventions and assigns relative importance to these outcomes based on the parameter \u03b4. The Qaly-PQaly function evaluates lifetimes by aggregating lifetimes the intervention yields multiplicatively, with the weight for each individual lifetime determined by a general function of health and productivity levels. The Qaly-PQaly function extends the notion of healthy years equivalent (e.g., HPE) to evaluate distributions by the unweighted aggregation of HPEs, while also accommodating other evaluation functions that have not been introduced in the previous section. The Qaly-PQaly function is characterized by combining the common set of axioms and time invariance at full health and productivity."

    {
      "header": "Discussion",
      "content": "The segment discusses how the choice of evaluation function in economic evaluations of health care or working environment interventions is crucial, guided by axioms that reflect societal acceptability, and how the evaluation function can be combined to assess combined health and productivity effects, with the help of specific axioms like time independence for unproductive individuals (TIUP) and time invariance at common health and productivity (TICHP), and how these choices can be made based on the acceptability of the evaluation function to the society introducing the working environment intervention, and how the parameters \u03c3, q(a i), p(i), and t(i) can be estimated using person trade-off methods, ultimately leading to the calculation of total effects in the intervention and control group using the QALY-PQaly evaluation function."
    },
    {
      "header": "Concluding remarks",
      "content": "The segment discusses various evaluation functions and their ethical and social implications, particularly focusing on structured evaluation functions with time-linear components, such as the power QALY functional form. These functions adjust years obtained based on available information about the years lived, reflecting the basic idea of adjusting years based on productivity. The segment also mentions alternative plausible interpretations and further generalizations within the framework, including the use of productivity weights, the interpretation of happiness or well-being, and the enlargement of the scope to account for more general evaluations with two instantaneous attributes (health and productivity) and a duration. The segment concludes by addressing the existence of a unique determined time * i for each t * i in the context of LMEHP and the range of the continuous social preferences function f."
