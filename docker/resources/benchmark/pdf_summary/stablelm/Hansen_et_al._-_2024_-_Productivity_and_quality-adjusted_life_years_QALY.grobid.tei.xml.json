The segment also introduces basic axioms for social preferences and characterizes the evaluation functions using these axioms, concluding with an application of these functions to Example 1 distributions and their relative preferences based on QALY and PALY evaluations."}, {"header": "Compromising between QALYs and PALYs", "content": "This segment discusses the evaluation functions in a model that evaluate distributions based on compromises between productivity and health, while addressing the problematic axioms of productivity and health independence, and introduces new axioms focusing on time invariance and productivity invariance at common health and time, ultimately characterizing the productivity-and-quality-adjusted life years (PQALY) evaluation function."}, {"header": "satisfies COMMON, TICHP, PICHT, and TIUP.", "content": "The QALY-PQALY evaluation function, represented by Theorem 6, evaluates distributions by a convex combination of the QALYs and PQALYs, considering both health effects and productivity effects as important outcomes of interventions. Dismissing the TIUP axiom results in the QALY-PQALY evaluation function, which assigns equal weight to pure health effects and productivity-adjusted life years, and does not increase the desirability of an intervention if improvements in lifetime among unproductive individuals do not increase the desirability. This evaluation function also subscribes to the same two invariance axioms as the QALY-PALY function. The QALY-PALY function, represented by Theorem 8, allows for a weaker time invariance axiom at common health and productivity, while the HPYE evaluation function, represented by Theorem 9, evaluates distributions by the unweighted aggregation of healthy productive years equivalent (HPYE) the intervention yields, and does not matter which particular individual receives these extra life years. The generalized HPYE evaluation function, represented by Theorem 10, is precisely characterized by the set of COMMON axioms, and does not necessarily follow a simple unweighted aggregation of HPYEs, as formalized by the evaluation function."}, {"header": "Discussion", "content": "The segment discusses how the choice of evaluation function in economic evaluations of health care or working environment interventions is guided by axioms, and how the evaluation functions can be used to rank different distributions and determine the most desirable intervention for society based on the importance of health and productivity effects, ultimately leading to the use of the QALY-PALY evaluation functions."}, {"header": "Concluding remarks", "content": "The segment discusses various interpretations and frameworks for evaluating well-being, productivity, and life years, highlighting the flexibility and potential for further generalizations in the context of chronic health states and time-varying health, as well as the ability to adapt evaluation functions to account for different attributes and preferences, such as happiness, productivity, and life satisfaction."}]}
