{"id": "Smith an", "name": "Smith and Coast - 2013 - The economic burden of antimicrobial resistance Why it is more serious than current studies suggest.grobid.tei.xml", "segments": [{"header": "Introduction", "content": "The development of antimicrobial resistance poses a significant challenge to healthcare in the 21st century, particularly in combating primary and secondary infections associated with diseases and the provision of healthcare, as emphasized by the paper, which highlights the need for policy implications and research evidence gaps to be addressed to mitigate its impact."}, {"header": "A brief history of AMR", "content": "The segment discusses the historical and current aspects of antimicrobial resistance, emphasizing that while natural selection can lead to microorganisms adapting to environmental pressures, the use of antimicrobial treatments can accelerate this process, potentially resulting in the emergence of resistant strains that render current therapies ineffective, necessitating a concern for the potential loss of effectiveness for any antimicrobial, despite various factors complicating the correlation between consumption and resistance."}, {"header": "The current situation", "content": "The escalating concern arises due to the simultaneous emergence of antibiotic-resistant organisms coinciding with a decline in new effective therapies entering the market, as the natural process of resistance is accelerated by ongoing antimicrobial use, while alternative treatments remain necessary to address the issue.<|im_end|>\nTo further elaborate, the historical context highlights that during the latter half of the 20th century, the discovery of various classes of therapeutics and specific therapeutics within these classes significantly expanded the antimicrobial 'armoury.' However, this progress was accompanied by the development of antibiotic resistance as a natural process, albeit accelerated by the widespread use of these antimicrobial agents"}, {"header": "FIGURE 1: DRUG DISCOVERY", "content": "The segment highlights the significant decline in antimicrobial drug development by major pharmaceutical companies, coupled with the increasing resistance of pathogens to multiple therapies, leading to the diminishing effectiveness of these treatments and the diminishing pipeline of new antimicrobials entering clinical practice, marking a crucial turning point in the history of infectious diseases, with the window of opportunity for antimicrobial therapies rapidly closing."}, {"header": "Current activities", "content": "Progress has been made in recent years in practice and policy to more appropriately use antimicrobials, particularly through prudent use, education, and infection control strategies, which have led to better antibiotic stewardship, shaping the debate on controlling antibiotic resistance and contributing to the containment of such resistance."}, {"header": "Why these are not sufficient", "content": "Despite progress and scientific consensus, the marginal impact of interventions on antimicrobial use remains insufficient to alter the inevitable loss of effective antimicrobial therapies, highlighting the ongoing challenges of widespread use, rapid transmission, and lack of new product development, with pharmaceutical incentives and policy barriers contributing to resistance; however, evidence suggests AMR has a minor cost impact compared to prevention and treatment strategies, emphasizing the need for long-term focus and cost-effectiveness in addressing this global issue."}, {"header": "Evidence on current economic burden", "content": "Treatment failure due to AMR contributes to increased healthcare costs, encompassing additional investigations, alternative treatments, side effects, longer hospital stays, reduced productivity, and a higher likelihood of death, while quantitatively, the burden varies depending on the assessment level, cost components, and disease focus, potentially leading to diverse figures and a range of costs associated with AMR treatment failure."}, {"header": "Updated literature review", "content": "The updated systematic literature review focused on the economic burden of resistance in English-language, peer-reviewed journals published since 2000, considering factors such as length of stay, mortality, patient cost, and societal cost related to AMR, while excluding cost-effectiveness analyses of alternative control strategies."}, {"header": "TABLE 1 SUMMARY OF COST DATA", "content": "The studies in Table 1 consistently demonstrate a wide range of costs for additional hospitalization/treatment, from less than \u00a35 to \u00a310 billion per year for full societal costs, primarily influenced by productivity losses in the US health system, with a predominance of hospital-based studies and underestimation of early mortality costs, despite an increase in studies over the last decade compared to prior to 2000, highlighting a low, selective, and divergent evidence base concerning the economic burden of AMR."}, {"header": "The case of MRSA", "content": "The segment discusses a case study comparing MRSA and MSSA resistance, highlighting the significant variation in costs across treatments, with costs remaining modest even at higher ends, while MRSA still offers a choice of therapy unlike some emerging resistant gram negatives."}, {"header": "BOX 1: A CASE STUDY OF MRSA", "content": "The relatively low cost for MRSA, in conjunction with AMR in general, is"}, {"header": "TABLE 2: COMPARATIVE ECONOMIC BURDEN", "content": "The modest economic impact of AMR, despite acknowledged threats to health and healthcare, is primarily linked to the incremental costs of treating resistance in primary infections, while overlooking the indirect future consequences on healthcare delivery in the presence of secondary infections, due to the limitations in assessing its current burden."}, {"header": "Limits of assessing 'costs of resistance'", "content": "The 'cost-of-illness' approach fails to accurately represent the true costs of Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR) due to the negligible externalities associated with antimicrobial consumption, the specific sigmoidal pattern of resistance development, and the discounted future effects of resistance development."}, {"header": "FIGURE 2: SIGMOIDAL DEVELOPMENT OF AMR", "content": "The segment highlights the critical implications of uncertainty regarding current and future transmission burdens, coupled with discounting of future benefits, making strategies to reduce transmission more cost-effective than controlling emergence, while also emphasizing the financial costs associated with maintaining public confidence in healthcare institutions, particularly concerning 'avoidable' infections driven by resistance, and the significant role of antimicrobials in enhancing treatment possibilities throughout human life, with the potential loss of these benefits due to the emergence of antibiotic resistance (AMR)."}, {"header": "BOX 2: CASE STUDY HIPS", "content": "The true cost of AMR, as represented by the potential return to the pre-antibiotic era, is significantly higher than the optimistic portrayal, as the integrated antimicrobial use in modern healthcare systems has transformed care practices, necessitating significant system redesign, increased healthcare costs, and wide-ranging economic impacts, including workforce implications."}, {"header": "Conclusion", "content": "The segment discusses the potential significant costs to healthcare and society in the future due to antimicrobial resistance, necessitating the rediscovery and management of effective antimicrobials as a scarce and nonrenewable resource, while also emphasizing the importance of optimal use and stewardship for the future, presenting three challenges."}, {"header": "Reducing uncertainty and increasing knowledge of full health system impacts", "content": "The segment highlights the uncertainty surrounding the future economic burden and technological changes required to mitigate the effects of antimicrobial resistance, while also emphasizing the need for better information to estimate the impact on healthcare systems and society, which requires collaboration among experts and the development of robust methods for data gathering and analysis."}, {"header": "Developing better, more radical, incentive mechanisms", "content": "To address the issue of incentivizing the development and appropriate use of antimicrobials, improvements are needed in protection and discouragement mechanisms at various levels, including greater public-private partnering, pre-purchase agreements, and direct public funding, while also considering individual choices and societal costs in terms of personal and societal costs, and balancing acceptability with the robustness of research strategies."}, {"header": "Enhancing international activity", "content": "The segment discusses the global issue of antimicrobial resistance, highlighting the importance of international collaboration for developing new drugs and diagnostics to combat multi-resistant bacteria, while also emphasizing the need for understanding resistance mechanisms, cost considerations, and strategies to control resistance without relying solely on new drug developments, and acknowledges the challenges of championing this issue in the UK while considering potential free-riding behavior from other countries and the influence of outside factors on anticipated research trajectories."}, {"header": "Lessons from climate change", "content": "AMR, like climate change, poses significant threats to human well-being due to over-consumption and uncertainty surrounding its extent and trajectory, but the inertia to change persists due to current burden and personal incentives, while global warming has successfully captured public attention and support for action, leading to routine individual actions and mainstream incorporation in daily life; however, the issue of resistance does not seem to resonate as strongly as global warming and the environment, potentially leading to delayed action to prevent apocalyptic scenarios."}, {"header": "BOX 2: CASE STUDY HIPS", "content": "The potential impact of removing antimicrobial therapies in the context of estimating the economic burden of future antimicrobial resistance, particularly in surgeries like hip replacements, is analyzed through examining the flow of patients undergoing total hip replacements, considering the effectiveness of prophylaxis and treatment options, and suggesting potential end states based on infection rates and treatment outcomes, highlighting the need for a more comprehensive analysis to understand the true economic burden of AMR."}, {"header": "Search Process", "content": "In the initial stage of the research, electronic database searching focused on generic terms related to antimicrobial resistance, costs, and limited resources, utilizing key terms from the previous review, with searches limited to Web of Science and Medline, focusing on titles and including specific terms such as antimicrobial resistance, costs, and specific databases like Web of Science and Medline."}, {"header": "Stage 2/4: Citation searching", "content": "During the review process, the reference lists of selected papers were scanned to identify additional relevant papers, while review papers themselves were utilized for citation-based searching at both initial and subsequent stages of the search."}, {"header": "Stage 3: Further electronic bibliographic database searching relating to specific terminology", "content": "Efforts to identify relevant empirical papers and review papers on the costs of resistance in relation to specific micro-organisms, particularly MRSA and VRE, were hindered by the absence of specific terminology and antimicrobials, necessitating a focused search on two of the most studied resistant infections, while considering limited resources and combining economic terms."}, {"header": "Inclusion criteria", "content": "The review focused on papers with empirical evidence on the economic impact of antimicrobial resistance, specifically addressing either primary data collection or secondary modeling, while considering factors such as length of stay, mortality, patient cost, societal cost, and a control group of susceptible infections published since 2000 in English, with no quality criteria influencing
