      "content": "A distributed communication network, consisting of agents with the ability to send messages and modify internal states based on received messages, operates in either synchronous or asynchronous communication steps, with varying graph structures and anonymity requirements, and utilizes algorithms like the averaging technique or discrete algebraic structures to analyze convergence and stability, while history trees provide optimal linear-time algorithms for dynamic networks with a temporal dimension, addressing challenges in challenging network situations."

      "content": "In this context, the focus is on dynamic anonymous networks operating in synchronous steps, represented as undirected multigraphs without port awareness. The distinction between agents becomes evident through history trees, which provide information on when agents become distinguishable. The software repository at https://github.com/viglietta/dynamic-networks offers a simulator for creating and visualizing history trees, as well as testing fundamental algorithms. The relationship between history trees and views in the works of Yamashita-Kameda and Boldi-Vigna is also discussed, highlighting the equivalence between the two concepts and illustrating their deep connection. The optimal time for distinguishability is determined by the number of agents in the networks, with the view at time n-1 representing the final state of distinguishability. The history tree structure allows for the determination of when agents become distinguishable, making it suitable for dynamic networks where the original network definition is not well-defined."

      "header": "Leader Election",
      "content": "The counting algorithm in section 2.3 for connected undirected dynamic networks with a unique leader, when extended to late outdegree awareness, yields stabilizing average consensus and counting algorithms for strongly connected directed dynamic networks with late outdegree awareness, which terminate in 3n -2 steps in the worst case, and can be optimized to 2n -2 steps if a known number of leaders is provided, ensuring a small gap with the lower bound of 2n -2 steps."
