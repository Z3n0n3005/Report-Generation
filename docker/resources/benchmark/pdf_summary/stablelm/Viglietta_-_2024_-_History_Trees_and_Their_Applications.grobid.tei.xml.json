The distinction between agents becomes evident through history trees, which provide information on when agents become distinguishable. The software repository at https://github.com/viglietta/dynamic-networks offers a simulator for creating and visualizing history trees, as well as testing fundamental algorithms. The relationship between history trees and views in the works of Yamashita-Kameda and Boldi-Vigna is also discussed, highlighting the equivalence between the two concepts and illustrating their deep connection. The optimal time for distinguishability is determined by the number of agents in the networks, with the view at time n-1 representing the final state of distinguishability. The history tree structure allows for the determination of when agents become distinguishable, making it suitable for dynamic networks where the original network definition is not well-defined."}, {"header": "Leader Election", "content": "The counting algorithm in section 2.3 for connected undirected dynamic networks with a unique leader, which stabilizes in 2n -2 steps, can be extended to handle late outdegree awareness and a known number of leaders, yielding stabilizing average consensus and counting algorithms for strongly connected directed dynamic networks with late outdegree awareness, achieving an optimal stabilization time of 2n -2 steps. The algorithm involves identifying non-branching levels, subdividing the history tree into â„“ intervals, and using outdegrees and multiplicities of red edges to compute linear equations, leading to an irreducible matrix. The algorithm finds upper bounds on node anonymity within branches and uses these to determine the deepest node's correct anonymity, ensuring no missing branches in the view."}]}
