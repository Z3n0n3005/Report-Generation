Such mechanisms have been proposed previously in non-human contexts to manage scarcity in traffic Karma and the aforementioned choice system are different from other token-based mechanisms that have been implemented and proposed in the past . The example illustrates that karma is similar in spirit to the 'universal currency' of reputation Further, the example also illustrates another feature"}]}, {"header": "EXPERIMENTAL METHODS", "content": [{"summary_text": "For urgency, we distinguished between a low stake process where participants have frequent events with moderate urgency . For richness, we tested a binary scheme where participants can choose from only two bid levels that depend on their karma . The game we study is one that proceeds with N participants over T -many rounds . Each participant is given an urgency value u (t)  u l , u h  that is drawn randomly and independently from a process P(u) that is identical"}]}, {"header": "RESULTS", "content": [{"summary_text": "In all treatments, more than 90% of the population is better off with karma than under random allocation . Our central welfare measure is the efficiency gain which we define next . For a particular participant i, let (u i (t)) t  1,...,T  be the vector of realized urgency in the experiment, and S rand i = 1 2 T t =1 u (t), the ex-ante expected total score ."}]}, {"header": "DISCUSSION", "content": [{"summary_text": "We compared the aggregate efficiency gains realized in our online experiments to those that would be achieved in theory in a short-sighted equilibrium . Theoretically, Nash equilibrium under binary bidding will lose in efficiency with more than two urgency levels, and it remains an open question to test what the trade-off is between behavioral simplicity of a binary (or otherwise limited) bidding scheme ."}]}]}
