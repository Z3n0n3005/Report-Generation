      "content": "the ability of organisms to develop resistance to the effects of antimicrobial therapies developed to kill them is potentially the greatest challenge to healthcare in the 21 st century. it increases the threat not only of primary infectious diseases such as tuberculosis, but also secondary infections associated both with other diseases and the provision of healthcare itself. modern healthcare was built over the last century on the basis that infections can be prevented or treated using antimicrobials (exemplified by the u.s. surgeon general famously proclaiming in 1968 that \"the war against diseases has been won\"). during this time healthcare has become increasingly technological and invasive, improving mortality and morbidity significantly. yet, many of these advances, especially within surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy, are based on the ability to prevent or cure infection that may result as a consequence of such care. the emergence and transmission of resistance threatens to undermine many of these advances (3). this paper is focused upon examining the economic burden that results from antimicrobial resistance (amr). in so doing, it highlights the 'temporal tension' between the burden observed in the present and that which may be predicted for the future. although the paper presents evidence about the current economic burden of amr, the main focus of the paper is on developing a hypothesis concerning the likely future trajectory in this area and the significant implications of that trajectory.the paper highlights the critical problem with the current emphasis on using economic burden as evidence for directing future investment in health issues, as well as difficulties related to methodologies available for estimating such burden. the paper concludes by considering the policy implications as well as the key research/evidence gaps and the challenges associated with filling those gaps. note also that we are concerned here with human use and human health -there are critical links with animal use and health (eg 8), but we do not have space to consider these in this report."

      "content": "before looking at the current economic burden of amr, however, it is worth reminding ourselves of the history of amr. resistance may be seen as essentially a reaction to the use of antimicrobial treatments. although the process of natural selection encourages micro-organisms to adapt to environmental pressures, the use of antimicrobial therapies can accelerate this natural process, whereby sensitive micro-organisms are soon eliminated by resistant ones (4). although there remain uncertainties over the development of resistance, the 'genetic cost' to the organism, and the extent to which resistance is temporary or permanent, there is concern that over time there is no reason to suspect that resistance will not occur to all antimicrobials; the only question is to what level.resistance means that an antimicrobial therapy is no longer (as) effective against the organism it is targeting. for any particular antimicrobial, the correlation between consumption and resistance is complicated by many factors, including the relative 'fitness' of sensitive and resistant strains, together with the existence of genetic elements simultaneously coding for resistance to several antimicrobials. this is important, as simply reducing the consumption of a specific antimicrobial cannot necessarily be relied upon to produce an equivalent reduction in resistance, and thus once the effectiveness of an antimicrobial is 'lost' it may be lost forever. this has been known since the 1940's, when the development of resistance to penicillin was documented just after it was discovered."

      "content": "in 2004, only 1.6% of drugs in development by the world's 15 largest drug companies were antimicrobials. a recent report from the european centre for disease prevention and control and european medicines agency identifies only two new drugs under development, both of which are in the early stages when failure rates are high. there have been many options proposed and discussed to try to encourage greater research and development in antimicrobials, but it has recently been voiced that \"today's dearth in the antibacterial research and development pipeline will take decades to reverse\"and that \"the existing classes of antibiotics are probably the best we will ever have. we are wary of creating an expectation that economic incentives can generate a pipeline to compensate for our squandering of this non-renewable resource\".at the same time that the number of new therapeutics has been declining, organisms such as s. aureus and e. faecium have been acquiring resistance to multiple therapies. consider, for instance, multi-drug resistant tuberculosis (mdr-tb); defined as resistance to at least isoniazid and rifampicin. the incidence and spread of mdr-tb is of concern to both the developed and developing world. for example, in the usa, mdr-tb epidemics have been reported in new york and florida, while in africa the incidence of mdr-tb continues to spread dramatically and extensively. this imposes a significant resource burden as the associated treatment costs are substantial, with some patients in the usa costing approximately $us1 million each to treat. and this is where there is still some other therapy as an option. where there are cases of totally drug resistant (tdr) infection there are no therapies that will provide an effective treatment; this is now the case for vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium. the rapid spread of any such organism is a clear cause for concern; antibiotic resistant bacteria do not stop at national boundaries and antimicrobial resistance is a global issue.to sum, organisms develop resistance to antimicrobials, and increasingly are developing resistance to multiple therapies, rendering these antimicrobials ineffective. at the same time, the once prolific pipeline bringing new antimicrobials into clinical practice is faltering. we are therefore at a pivotal stage in the history of infectious disease, where the window of opportunity afforded by antimicrobial therapies over recent decades is rapidly closing."

      "header": "Why these are not sufficient",
      "content": "although there have been positive changes, and many within the scientific community are now convinced of the need for action, the question is whether interventions such as these remain marginal in relation to the total size of the problem, with insufficient impact on reductions in antimicrobial use to change a future in which the loss of effective antimicrobial therapies is inevitable. this question of marginality is pertinent both to the within-country context (is there sufficient reduction in usage in one setting such as the uk?) and the cross-country context (is there sufficient reduction in usage globally?). the core problems, of widespread use, rapid transmission and lack of new product development, remain. in this respect, incentives continue to be the major concern at all levels.as indicated above (figure), there has been an almost total shutdown in new product development.notwithstanding whether the possible compounds for discovery have been exhausted, this is unsurprising; there are few incentives for pharmaceutical companies to develop a new drug for which health systems will aim to restrict useand thus potential profits. this is particularly true within the current system for incentivising r&d into new therapies -the patent system targeted at private companies -where companies wish to sell as much as possible as quickly as possible to generate revenue and recoup development costs. in restricting the use of new antimicrobials until absolutely necessary, it would be likely that the major use of such 'saved' drugs would be after the end of the patent period.similarly, there are incentive problems with achieving conservative use of antimicrobials. for each individual who wants to take an antimicrobial to feel better, the impact on resistance of their specific antimicrobial use is virtually unidentifiable, making it very hard to enforce a substantive reduction in use, even in areas deemed 'inappropriate'; in this respect the antimicrobial problem is identical to that of global warming, where the contribution of each car journey, for example, is minimal but the sum of all such journeys is substantial.there are also incentive problems for policy makers. there is growing emphasis on evidence-based policy making, which includes considering the economic burden of disease, and the demonstrated cost-effectiveness of therapies. put simply, this way of informing policy requires burden to be high now in order to justify expenditure on new drugs, and especially to justify it on the basis of cost-effectiveness, and the cost of resistance needs to be high now to justify greater restriction on use of current drugs. note the emphasis on now.however, as outlined below, evidence to date is that amr has only a comparatively minor cost impact. there are, of course, considerable parallels here with wider aspects of prevention versus treatment when health budgets and results are expected to focus upon the short term, and at the mercy of the political cycle, which encourages group myopia. nonetheless, in the case of resistance this is more pronounced and arguably, since once resistance develops it may be irreversible, more important."

    {
      "header": "Evidence on current economic burden",
      "content": "qualitatively we know that treatment failure caused by amr contributes to increased costs of care associated with: additional investigations such as laboratory tests and x-ray examinations; additional or alternative treatments, often much more expensive than drugs used to treat infections caused by sensitive organisms; additional sideeffects from more toxic treatments, which have to be managed; longer hospital stay; longer time off work; reduced quality of life and productivity; greater likelihood of death due to inadequate or delayed treatment, hence reducing the workforce; increased burden on family of infected individual; increases in private insurance coverage; additional cost for hospital when hospital-acquired infection occurs and infection control procedures required; increased costs of disease surveillance; increased costs to firms of absenteeism, possibly leading to increased product prices; and so forth. and this is not including costs associated with surveillance and activities associated with trying to control resistance itself.yet, quantitatively, the problem is that, far from illuminating the burden of resistance, this translates into a vast range of figures depending upon what precisely is assessed. cost estimates will depend on, for instance, whether assessment is at the level of the individual or (multiple) institutions, whether figures are based on comparison of a resistant versus susceptible patient/infection or they are total costs of care (resistant versus nothing), whether figures include hospital costs only, look at patient costs, or incorporate productivity costs (i.e. consider the health care or the 'societal' perspective), and the methods used to estimate these costs, whether they are focused on one or multiple disease areas, and whether preventative control measures are included. this lack of consistency or comparability of methods used to assess economic impact generates problems in assessing the true scale of the problem, as discussed further below.an important, although now dated, review of these studies found that patients infected with resistant organisms generally had poorer health and economic outcomes than those patients with susceptible organisms. a more recent review has shown higher costs, in the order of $6-30,000 per patient per episode for resistant compared to susceptible s. aureus, enterococci and gram negative bacilli. this latter review noted that evidence suggests though that there are not big increases in cost, resource use or mortality from resistance; a finding backed up in other recent studies."

      "content": "we also previously undertook a systematic literature review concerning the economics of amr, summarizing studies focusing upon the costs of resistance published up to 2000. this review focused both on costs of amr and the costeffectiveness of control strategies. it found a total of 43 studies, although 22 were categorised at high risk of bias and excluded from analysis. of the 21 remaining studies, most were from the usa and hospital based. in terms of costs of resistance, most indicated areas of resource impact rather than reporting monetary values, and those that did report monetary values produced wide variances, although all well below \u00a3100,000 per annum per institution.for this current paper, we updated these searches to focus on papers published since 2000 which reported the cost impact of resistance in english-language, peerreviewed journals, where we could extract any or all of length of stay, mortality, patient cost and/or societal cost that may be attributable to amr. the focus of this updating review, in line with the dh brief and the focus of this paper, was the economic burden of resistance; it excluded review of the literature on the costeffectiveness of alternative control strategies which is concerned with policy options for dealing with the issue, rather than the nature of the issue itself.initial searches were only conducted on combinations of resistant/ce, antimicrob/ial and cost/s; as it became clear that papers that did not refer to antimicrobial resistance more generally, but only to either particular drugs or particular microorganisms (an indicator of a much more fundamental problem, to which we return in the discussion), would not be captured in this search, a subsequent search focused particularly on mrsa and vre, as two of the most studied and potentially more serious current resistant infections. these studies are summarized in table."

      "header": "TABLE 1 SUMMARY OF COST DATA",
      "content": "the studies listed in table 1 are consistent with previous reviews, indicating three key findings that appear robust to change over time.first, there are a vast range of figures, from less than \u00a35 to more than \u00a320,000 in reported additional costs per patient per episode for hospital costs, and anything up to around \u00a310 billion per year for full societal costs. these figures are largely determined by whether and how productivity losses are incorporated.second, most studies originate in the usa. this may be a reflection of the englishlanguage journals included in the search, but such a degree of national dominance is still unusual. given the very unique nature of the us health system, and its financial structure, these costs are unlikely to be indicative of other systems, such as the uk.third, there is a heavy predominance of hospital-based studies, and indeed the costs are almost exclusively related to costs of additional hospitalization/treatment and do not include costs associated with early mortality; from an economic perspective this almost certainly underestimates the cost. there is only one uk empirical study, which also happens to be one of only two community studies, and one uk study that is the only one to apply a macro-economic modelling technique. whilst hospital costs are inevitably higher on a per patient basis, there may, however, be significant unassessed costs among patients infected with resistant strains who remain in a community setting, where even a small increase in costs at the individual level may, because of higher prevalence, result in a relatively high burden on the community overall.overall, in sum, although there has been a substantial increase in studies over the last decade compared with prior to 2000, there remains a low, selective and widely divergent evidence base concerning 'the economic burden of amr'."

    {
      "header": "TABLE 2: COMPARATIVE ECONOMIC BURDEN",
      "content": "the paradox of the relatively low level of economic impact current evidence therefore suggests that the economic burden from amr is actually quite modest, even though amr is acknowledged to be a significant threat to health and healthcare. this apparent inconsistency might arise because current estimates of the cost of amr are based loosely on the 'incremental' cost related to the extra treatment of resistant over (actual or assumed) susceptible infection. these costs, broadly speaking, increase as we see multi-drug resistance (mdr) emerge (such as in the case of mdr-tb), but at present organisms that are mdr remain relatively rare and often occur in isolated outbreaks. the highest costs -if we exclude productivity losses, discussed in the next section -are those where organisms are totally resistant, where no therapy is effective creating high service use and the eventual death of the patient. in these very rare cases the cost is of a magnitude higher as we are looking at intensive (and often terminal) care, rather than merely a little extra length of stay or another slightly more expensive therapy. these latter cases are an indication of the potential future cost associated with increasing types of resistant infection and increasing transmission of those infections, as once there are no therapies that are effective, mortality, morbidity and the associated economic burden may take a quantum leap; not just in the treatment of primary infection, but critically as routine procedures are severely compromised by untreatable secondary infection. (an example of such a situation is extensively drugresistant tuberculosis (xdtrb). whilst a recent study in the uk found that the numbers infected with xdrtb were still small, it also identified extremely high mortality rates in the order of more than 60%.)the economic consequences of amr outlined in the papers reviewed relate only to the direct impacts of resistance itself on the ability to treat primary infections; which, as indicated, tend to be incremental. of potentially greater importance is the more indirect future impact that resistance may have on the ability of the health service to deliver other forms of healthcare in the presence of increasing rates of secondary infection. here there is no evidence that we are aware of. before moving on to consider this issue further, however, it is worth reflecting upon the limitations of attempting to assess the current burden of amr."

      "header": "Limits of assessing 'costs of resistance'",
      "content": "a standard 'cost-of-illness' approach will not capture the true nature of the costs of amr for three reasons. first, amr is a negative externality associated with consumption of antimicrobials. that is, it has an undesirable effect which is distant from the current consumption decision. this distance arises in two ways. first, consumption of an antimicrobial will contribute to organisms generating resistance to its effects, and thus other people will suffer from reduced effectiveness. second, that lower effectiveness will impact on the original consumer, but in the future not the present.the problem is that the externality effect from each antimicrobial consumed is miniscule, especially once the future effects are discounted. thus, even if it were possible to increase the cost of consumption (e.g. price of antimicrobial, or cost of prescription) to incorporate some value of externality (the standard economic approach), it would only be extremely minor for each individual decision and highly unlikely to induce any reduction in consumption. so, the externality effect means that the cost of resistance is not reflected in current prices, but even if it were it would be so minor for each individual consumer that it would not cause an impact on consumption.second, the specific sigmoidal pattern of the development of resistance, illustrated in figure, means that the cost will be low when there is scope to prevent resistance emerging (as quickly) but once it is observably high there may be little that can be done to prevent the transmission of a heavily resistant organism. that is, in general, the development of resistance over time appears to follow a sigmoid (or epidemic) distribution, with a lag phase before resistance appears (time x), then a relatively rapid increase in the proportion of resistant organisms, followed by a third phase (time x+n) in which this proportion reaches an equilibrium. this equilibrium level is determined by the relative 'fitness' of resistant and sensitive strains, the genetic basis and stability of resistance and the magnitude of the selection pressure. thus, the cost during the lag phase when resistance is low -approximated by most studies to date -is correspondingly low, and vice versa once resistance is high, but the critical point is the phase of rapid advancement, where the 'epidemic' of resistance may be such as to be unstoppable. where we act determines whether we are looking at prevention of excessive resistance or mitigation of high levels."

      "content": "the critical implication is that this uncertainty regarding current and future burden combined with discounting of future benefits means that strategies to reduce transmission are far more likely to appear cost-effective than strategies to control emergence, hence reinforcing the status-quo.third, estimates of cost-of-illness tend not to focus on less direct costs associated with the impact of resistance on patient safety or public confidence in health care institutions. public and media concerns frequently focus on the plight of individuals who suffer what is seen to be 'avoidable' infection within a context where the institution is empowered and the patient is both vulnerable and dependent. there is therefore a cost to maintaining public confidence in healthcare providers and institutions.the future? antimicrobials are the cornerstone of modern medicine that revolutionized healthcare during the last half-century. from cradle to grave, the role of antimicrobials in safeguarding the overall health of human societies has become pivotal. so the 'real' costs of amr are those that relate to the loss of these benefits; the treatment possibilities at every stage of human life that have been enabled and enhanced because of antimicrobials. we know, for example, that mdr bacteria have increased mortality rates amongst newborn babies, transplantation recipients (56-58) and cancer patients (59, 60), but we do not know very much beyond these few isolated case studies, and know nothing about their economic implications. thus, in order to calculate the full potential economic burden of amr we have to consider the burden associated with not having antimicrobial therapies at all. to our knowledge, this has not been attempted. we have therefore provided an illustration in box 2. although this is a greatly simplified illustrative example of one specific area, relating to hip replacements, it indicates the complexity involved in attempting to assess the true level of the likely economic burden of amr. however, despite this complexity, we would suggest that this form of analysis -for the health system overall, not just specific diseases -is the single most important step in understanding the likely future burden of amr in order to assist with planning, resource allocation and policy making with respect to the development and use of antimicrobials today."

(for instance, dealing with climate change involves reduction in car use, but also making cars more efficient, and we 'solved' the issue of chlorofluorocarbons (cfcs) and ozone depletion by simply replacing all cfcs with non-damaging gases in airconditioning and refrigerator units.)here, alternatives to antimicrobials include vaccination, but could also include structuring of care such that infection is less likely, for example changes to ventilation systems, bed spacing and so on. we are therefore faced with considerable uncertainty, but uncertainty that suggests we need to incur some (perhaps considerable) cost now associated with current reduced use of antimicrobials, in the expectation of some future, indeterminate but likely far greater, cost being averted. to judge the scale of 'acceptable' cost now, however, we need much better information about both likely future trajectory and the cost implications under different trajectories.a key research need is thus to estimate the impact of widespread resistance to the health system overall, and to wider society. the current focus, on the additional cost of treating an infectious disease in the presence of resistance, needs to be complemented by looking at how services such as those relating to cancer care, heart disease and diabetes might be affected. such research will be a challenge not just in funding terms but in terms of bringing together those with the relevant expertise, ensuring that they can 'talk to each other' and developing methods that can both identify crucial gaps in the information base and, ultimately, provide robust estimates."

      "content": "the problem facing any attempt to estimate the impact of removal of antimicrobial therapies is data from such a situation; such therapies are, and have been, part of routine care ever since hip replacements became available, both as prophylaxis and as treatment for hai. in an attempt to think laterally, we therefore looked at information relating to amputation -another major surgery involving limbs -as a proxy for what rates may have been pre-and post-antimicrobial discovery. we used this information, together with current studies looking at the infection pathway for hip replacement, to construct and suggest possible values for the flow of patients requiring hip replacement, illustrated below.here we have patients undergoing total hip replacement (tha) having prophylaxis or not, and from this having infections or not, being treated or not, and rates of effectiveness translating to final outcomes. currently, prophylaxis is standard practice so approximately 100% of patients follow route 4 rather than 5. infection rates, at 6, are approximately 0.5-2%, so most patients go down route 7. most of those following 6, go to 10 and have further treatment which is successful. most patients therefore exit at 15 or 18 (>99%).if we estimate this flow with no antimicrobials, we are therefore restricting possibilities to route 5, and for those at 8, route 13 -and hence end states of 21, 22 or 23. here, at point 8 rates of post-operative infection are around 40-50%; of these, 30% go on to die -state 21. thus, removal of antibiotics can be estimated to lead to an increased in post-operative infection from approximately 1% to 50%, and deaths from approximately 0% to 30%. of course, at such rates the expectation is simply that the rates of hip replacement would dramatically fall, and thus increase the burden of morbidity from higher levels of hip pain.clearly this represents a very crude estimate, for just one clinical area using antibiotics, but indicates the form of analysis required if we are to move towards beginning to estimate the full, true, economic burden of future amr, with the removal of the option of antimicrobial therapies from a number of treatment pathways, both urgent and elective.  in line with the dh brief, the purpose of the literature review was to conduct a short review describing the economic burden (cost impact) of antimicrobial resistance. an earlier systematic literature review concerning the economics of resistance, and published in 2002, had considered this as one among a number of questions relating to the economics of antimicrobial resistance. at the time little evidence relating to this issue was found. there appeared to have been, however, a growth in this literature over recent years, hence the focus on this particular question."
