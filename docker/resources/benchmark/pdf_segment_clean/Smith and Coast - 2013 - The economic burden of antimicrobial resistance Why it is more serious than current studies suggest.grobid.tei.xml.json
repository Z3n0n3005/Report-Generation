      "content": "The ability of organisms to develop resistance to the effects of antimicrobial therapies developed to kill them is potentially the greatest challenge to healthcare in the 21 st century. It increases the threat not only of primary infectious diseases such as tuberculosis, but also secondary infections associated both with other diseases and the provision of healthcare itself The paper highlights the critical problem with the current emphasis on using economic burden as evidence for directing future investment in health issues, as well as difficulties related to methodologies available for estimating such burden. The paper concludes by considering the policy implications as well as the key research/evidence gaps and the challenges associated with filling those gaps. Note also that we are concerned here with human use and human health -there are critical links with animal use and health (eg 8), but we do not have space to consider these in this report."

      "header": "A brief history of AMR",
      "content": "Before looking at the current economic burden of AMR, however, it is worth reminding ourselves of the history of AMR. Resistance may be seen as essentially a reaction to the use of antimicrobial treatments. Although the process of natural selection encourages micro-organisms to adapt to environmental pressures, the use of antimicrobial therapies can accelerate this natural process, whereby sensitive micro-organisms are soon eliminated by resistant ones (4). Although there remain uncertainties over the development of resistance, the 'genetic cost' to the organism, and the extent to which resistance is temporary or permanent, there is concern that over time there is no reason to suspect that resistance will not occur to all antimicrobials; the only question is to what level Resistance means that an antimicrobial therapy is no longer (as) effective against the organism it is targeting. For any particular antimicrobial, the correlation between consumption and resistance is complicated by many factors, including the relative 'fitness' of sensitive and resistant strains, together with the existence of genetic elements simultaneously coding for resistance to several antimicrobials. This is important, as simply reducing the consumption of a specific antimicrobial cannot necessarily be relied upon to produce an equivalent reduction in resistance, and thus once the effectiveness of an antimicrobial is 'lost' it may be lost forever "

It is because the increase in organisms resistant to multiple therapies is now coinciding with the reduction in new therapies coming to market to replace ineffective ones.That resistance develops to an antimicrobial therapy is not itself a problem -and as indicated is merely a natural process, albeit accelerated by use of these therapiesas long as there are other therapies to take its place. During the latter half of the 20 th century this was the predominant situation. Over this period the various classes of therapeutics, and the specific therapeutics within these classes, were discovered and the antimicrobial 'armoury' was added to on a regular basis "

Aureus and E. faecium have been acquiring resistance to multiple therapies To sum, organisms develop resistance to antimicrobials, and increasingly are developing resistance to multiple therapies, rendering these antimicrobials ineffective. At the same time, the once prolific pipeline bringing new antimicrobials into clinical practice is faltering. We are therefore at a pivotal stage in the history of infectious disease, where the window of opportunity afforded by antimicrobial therapies over recent decades is rapidly closing "

There are various policy, public and professional reports and strategies Work, such as that in the UK, is enabling us to become better custodians of antibiotics, reshaping the debate on how to control AMR. This has involved encouraging better diagnosis, medicine management and use of therapeutics by promoting the prudent use of antimicrobials and educating healthcare workers to use antibiotics more appropriately (i.e. only when needed, ensuring correct dose and duration for treatment), as well as promoting good infection control (e.g. hand hygiene, screening, patient isolation) to prevent and control AMR. These interventions have been informed by surveillance activities. This work has helped to strengthen surveillance, infection prevention and control, and to promote the responsible use of antimicrobials in the UK. It can be expected to have an impact on the containment of antimicrobial resistance."

    {
      "header": "Why these are not sufficient",
      "content": "Although there have been positive changes, and many within the scientific community are now convinced of the need for action, the question is whether interventions such as these remain marginal in relation to the total size of the problem, with insufficient impact on reductions in antimicrobial use to change a future in which the loss of effective antimicrobial therapies is inevitable. This question of marginality is pertinent both to the within-country context (is there sufficient reduction in usage in one setting such as the UK?) and the cross-country context (is there sufficient reduction in usage globally?). The core problems, of widespread use, rapid transmission and lack of new product development, remain. In this respect, incentives continue to be the major concern at all levels.As indicated above (figure Notwithstanding whether the possible compounds for discovery have been exhausted, this is unsurprising; there are few incentives for pharmaceutical companies to develop a new drug for which health systems will aim to restrict use Similarly, there are incentive problems with achieving conservative use of antimicrobials. For each individual who wants to take an antimicrobial to feel better, the impact on resistance of their specific antimicrobial use is virtually unidentifiable, making it very hard to enforce a substantive reduction in use, even in areas deemed 'inappropriate' There are also incentive problems for policy makers. There is growing emphasis on evidence-based policy making, which includes considering the economic burden of disease, and the demonstrated cost-effectiveness of therapies. Put simply, this way of informing policy requires burden to be high now in order to justify expenditure on new drugs, and especially to justify it on the basis of cost-effectiveness, and the cost of resistance needs to be high now to justify greater restriction on use of current drugs However, as outlined below, evidence to date is that AMR has only a comparatively minor cost impact. There are, of course, considerable parallels here with wider aspects of prevention versus treatment when health budgets and results are expected to focus upon the short term, and at the mercy of the political cycle, which encourages group myopia "
    },
    {
      "header": "Evidence on current economic burden",
      "content": "Qualitatively we know that treatment failure caused by AMR contributes to increased costs of care associated with: additional investigations such as laboratory tests and X-ray examinations; additional or alternative treatments, often much more expensive than drugs used to treat infections caused by sensitive organisms; additional sideeffects from more toxic treatments, which have to be managed; longer hospital stay; longer time off work; reduced quality of life and productivity; greater likelihood of death due to inadequate or delayed treatment, hence reducing the workforce; increased burden on family of infected individual; increases in private insurance coverage; additional cost for hospital when hospital-acquired infection occurs and infection control procedures required; increased costs of disease surveillance; increased costs to firms of absenteeism, possibly leading to increased product prices; and so forth Yet, quantitatively, the problem is that, far from illuminating the burden of resistance, this translates into a vast range of figures depending upon what precisely is assessed. Cost estimates will depend on, for instance, whether assessment is at the level of the individual or (multiple) institutions, whether figures are based on comparison of a resistant versus susceptible patient/infection or they are total costs of care (resistant versus nothing), whether figures include hospital costs only, look at patient costs, or incorporate productivity costs (i.e. consider the health care or the 'societal' perspective), and the methods used to estimate these costs, whether they are focused on one or multiple disease areas, and whether preventative control measures are included An important, although now dated, review of these studies found that patients infected with resistant organisms generally had poorer health and economic outcomes than those patients with susceptible organisms "

The focus of this updating review, in line with the DH brief and the focus of this paper, was the economic burden of resistance; it excluded review of the literature on the costeffectiveness of alternative control strategies which is concerned with policy options for dealing with the issue, rather than the nature of the issue itself.Initial searches were only conducted on combinations of resistant/ce, antimicrob/ial and cost/s; as it became clear that papers that did not refer to antimicrobial resistance more generally, but only to either particular drugs or particular microorganisms (an indicator of a much more fundamental problem, to which we return in the discussion), would not be captured in this search, a subsequent search focused particularly on MRSA and VRE, as two of the most studied and potentially more serious current resistant infections. These studies are summarized in table "
    },
    {
      "header": "TABLE 1 SUMMARY OF COST DATA",
      "content": "The studies listed in table 1 are consistent with previous reviews, indicating three key findings that appear robust to change over time.First, there are a vast range of figures, from less than \u00a35 to more than \u00a320,000 in reported additional costs per patient per episode for hospital costs, and anything up to around \u00a310 billion per year for full societal costs. These figures are largely determined by whether and how productivity losses are incorporated Second, most studies originate in the USA. This may be a reflection of the Englishlanguage journals included in the search, but such a degree of national dominance is still unusual. Given the very unique nature of the US health system, and its financial structure, these costs are unlikely to be indicative of other systems, such as the UK.Third, there is a heavy predominance of hospital-based studies, and indeed the costs are almost exclusively related to costs of additional hospitalization/treatment and do not include costs associated with early mortality; from an economic perspective this almost certainly underestimates the cost. There is only one UK empirical study, which also happens to be one of only two community studies, and one UK study that is the only one to apply a macro-economic modelling technique Overall, in sum, although there has been a substantial increase in studies over the last decade compared with prior to 2000, there remains a low, selective and widely divergent evidence base concerning 'the economic burden of AMR'."

      "content": "The paradox of the relatively low level of economic impact Current evidence therefore suggests that the economic burden from AMR is actually quite modest, even though AMR is acknowledged to be a significant threat to health and healthcare. This apparent inconsistency might arise because current estimates of the cost of AMR are based loosely on the 'incremental' cost related to the extra treatment of resistant over (actual or assumed) susceptible infection. These costs, broadly speaking, increase as we see multi-drug resistance (MDR) emerge (such as in the case of MDR-TB The economic consequences of AMR outlined in the papers reviewed relate only to the direct impacts of resistance itself on the ability to treat primary infections; which, as indicated, tend to be incremental. Of potentially greater importance is the more indirect future impact that resistance may have on the ability of the health service to deliver other forms of healthcare in the presence of increasing rates of secondary infection. Here there is no evidence that we are aware of. Before moving on to consider this issue further, however, it is worth reflecting upon the limitations of attempting to assess the current burden of AMR."

Public and media concerns frequently focus on the plight of individuals who suffer what is seen to be 'avoidable' infection within a context where the institution is empowered and the patient is both vulnerable and dependent. There is therefore a cost to maintaining public confidence in healthcare providers and institutions.The future? Antimicrobials are the cornerstone of modern medicine that revolutionized healthcare during the last half-century. From cradle to grave, the role of antimicrobials in safeguarding the overall health of human societies has become pivotal. So the 'real' costs of AMR are those that relate to the loss of these benefits; the treatment possibilities at every stage of human life that have been enabled and enhanced because of antimicrobials. We know, for example, that MDR bacteria have increased mortality rates amongst newborn babies "

      "content": "The 'true' cost of AMR It has been said that AMR presents a risk that we will fall back into the pre-antibiotic era (3). However, this is perhaps a more rosy picture than the reality. The health system has changed fundamentally over the last 60 years, with antimicrobials integrated in almost all aspects of care. The system is designed to treat more chronic conditions, provide treatments on a short-term -often day-case -basis, and encourage prevention. As Box 2 illustrates, in many cases antimicrobials are given as a matter of standard prophylactic care. As witnessed when there are outbreaks of hospital-acquired infection, the system can very quickly come to a standstill Multiplied across all the hundreds of clinical areas where antimicrobials are currently used, it can easily be envisaged that this will not only be a significant health burden, and present increased healthcare cost (inpatient stay) itself, but would present a catastrophic blow to health system development -for instance, requiring redesign of many facilities, the reintroduction of sanatoria and so forth. The full economic burden of this is not only inestimable at present, but unimaginable. Increasing rates of infection to the level this would also have enormous wider economic impacts (significant workforce impacts "

      "header": "Conclusion",
      "content": "We are entering a pivotal period where, if current trends continue, there could be highly significant costs to healthcare, and society more generally, as antimicrobials that form the basis of modern healthcare become increasingly ineffective. As AMR is a natural process, we are not looking at something that can be 'eradicated'; rather, it is something we have to manage if we are to continue to benefit from antimicrobial therapies Effective antimicrobials therefore need rediscovering as a scarce -and largely nonrenewable -resource (3). This requires an assessment of the balance between the positive effects of using antimicrobial therapies now, and the negative impact of this use on their temporal effectiveness, and hence assessment of the optimal use of antimicrobials over time. As with other areas of prevention, and issues such as global warming, we need to pursue a path that does not place undue emphasis on current burdens and costs, but reflects the importance of stewardship for the future. The presents us with three challenges."

      "header": "Reducing uncertainty and increasing knowledge of full health system impacts",
      "content": "We know the current economic burden is relatively low compared with other problems. Yet we do not know to what extent the future burden will grow, or how quickly. We also do not know whether an increasing burden will give impetus to new technological change outside the drug arena that might mitigate effects. (For instance, dealing with climate change involves reduction in car use, but also making cars more efficient, and we 'solved' the issue of Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and ozone depletion by simply replacing all CFCs with non-damaging gases in airconditioning and refrigerator units.)Here, alternatives to antimicrobials include vaccination, but could also include structuring of care such that infection is less likely, for example changes to ventilation systems, bed spacing and so on. We are therefore faced with considerable uncertainty, but uncertainty that suggests we need to incur some (perhaps considerable) cost now associated with current reduced use of antimicrobials, in the expectation of some future, indeterminate but likely far greater, cost being averted. To judge the scale of 'acceptable' cost now, however, we need much better information about both likely future trajectory and the cost implications under different trajectories.A key research need is thus to estimate the impact of widespread resistance to the health system overall, and to wider society. The current focus, on the additional cost of treating an infectious disease in the presence of resistance, needs to be complemented by looking at how services such as those relating to cancer care, heart disease and diabetes might be affected. Such research will be a challenge not just in funding terms but in terms of bringing together those with the relevant expertise, ensuring that they can 'talk to each other' and developing methods that can both identify crucial gaps in the information base and, ultimately, provide robust estimates."

      "content": "There needs to be an improvement in the incentive mechanisms at a number of levels. In terms of the development of new antimicrobials, if new therapies are discovered then they need to be protected, and hence the use of them discouraged. New options are needed that can discourage high levels of use whilst avoiding disincentives for private sector R&D into new therapies, such as greater publicprivate partnering, pre-purchase agreement, or direct public funding, which seems to be occurring at present but, compared with current estimates of costs of discovery to market, remain small In terms of individuals and their choice about whether to take antimicrobials, more needs to be done to balance the personal cost (minimal in the UK, and largely related to accessing a consultation, collecting a prescription and possible side effects) with the true societal cost. Some thought has previously been given to such mechanisms The acceptability of such restrictions may, of course, be related to whether the research discussed above is sufficiently robust to sustain such developments. Implementation of any radical -rather than currently marginal -strategies would require considerable public support to be politically acceptable, and in this respect much may be learnt perhaps from the environmental movement, as discussed further below."

It may also be vital to research to increase understanding of resistance mechanisms, cost trajectories, and means of controlling resistance in the absence of new drug developments. There is appreciation of this issue in the UK, where a multi-pronged integrated UK strategy is under development (building on previous work and taking account of developments at EU and international level) and where championing the issue at EU and international levels is also an important focus.It is also important, however, to consider the extent to which a UK strategy needs to account for the likely success or otherwise of such championing, given that countries may have some incentive to free-ride on the actions of others, and given that outside influences may well affect the likely trajectories anticipated in the research described above "

    {
      "header": "Lessons from climate change",
      "content": "As alluded to earlier, AMR, as a policy target, shares many of the characteristics of climate change. Both provide future significant threats to human well-being, both are subject to considerable uncertainty about their future extent and trajectory, both are global problems where the response differs across nations, and both have as an underlying cause the over-consumption of 'goods' that lead to short term benefit. Yet for both antimicrobial resistance and climate change there is considerable inertia to the major, radical, change required to move from mitigation to prevention, because there is a focus on current burden and because the personal incentives seldom match those of society more generally.There do appear to be some differences, however. In particular, there appears to be increasing scientific consensus about the impact of global warming in a way that is perhaps less clear -or at least coherent -for antimicrobial resistance. Clear, simple and consistent messages from the scientific community have been vital in developing the increased acceptance of the desirability of action on global warming to a broader policy making community including politicians, economists and philanthropists. This consensus, along with sustained and high profile campaigns and the impact of positive media attention (including Hollywood movies), has increased public support. Combined with simple messages on what individuals can do (e.g. 'reduce, reuse, recycle'), this has moved climate change into the mainstream of activities -to the extent that many aspects of individual action are now routine (e.g. recycling, house insulation etc.). The issue of resistance does not seem to have captured the public imagination, attention or support for change to the degree that global warming and the environment has.For antimicrobial resistance there is a clear danger that waiting for the burden to become significant before taking action may mean waiting until it is too late to stop an apocalyptic scenario -the very drive behind the early environmental movement's advocacy of the 'precautionary principle'.  MRSA has also recently emerged as an important cause of community-associated infections. Although several compounds have been developed, or resurrected, to treat gram-positive infections such as S. Aureus, none have been shown to work better than vancomycin, all have important toxic effects, and resistance to each has already been observed (including linezolid-resistant VRE in patients who have never received the drug) In economic terms, illustrated by table 1, MRSA adds around $20,000 per patient per episode to the cost of hospital treatment in the USA "

      "content": "The problem facing any attempt to estimate the impact of removal of antimicrobial therapies is data from such a situation; such therapies are, and have been, part of routine care ever since hip replacements became available, both as prophylaxis and as treatment for HAI. In an attempt to think laterally, we therefore looked at information relating to amputation -another major surgery involving limbs -as a proxy for what rates may have been pre-and post-antimicrobial discovery. We used this information, together with current studies looking at the infection pathway for hip replacement, to construct and suggest possible values for the flow of patients requiring hip replacement, illustrated below.Here we have patients undergoing total hip replacement (THA) having prophylaxis or not, and from this having infections or not, being treated or not, and rates of effectiveness translating to final outcomes. Currently, prophylaxis is standard practice so approximately 100% of patients follow route 4 rather than 5. Infection rates, at 6, are approximately 0.5-2%, so most patients go down route 7. Most of those following 6, go to 10 and have further treatment which is successful. Most patients therefore exit at 15 or 18 (>99%).If we estimate this flow with no antimicrobials, we are therefore restricting possibilities to route 5, and for those at 8, route 13 -and hence end states of 21, 22 or 23. Here, at point 8 rates of post-operative infection are around 40-50%; of these, 30% go on to die -state 21 Clearly this represents a very crude estimate, for just one clinical area using antibiotics, but indicates the form of analysis required if we are to move towards beginning to estimate the full, true, economic burden of future AMR, with the removal of the option of antimicrobial therapies from a number of treatment pathways, both urgent and elective.  In line with the DH brief, the purpose of the literature review was to conduct a short review describing the economic burden (cost impact) of antimicrobial resistance. An earlier systematic literature review concerning the economics of resistance, and published in 2002, had considered this as one among a number of questions relating to the economics of antimicrobial resistance. At the time little evidence relating to this issue was found. There appeared to have been, however, a growth in this literature over recent years, hence the focus on this particular question."
