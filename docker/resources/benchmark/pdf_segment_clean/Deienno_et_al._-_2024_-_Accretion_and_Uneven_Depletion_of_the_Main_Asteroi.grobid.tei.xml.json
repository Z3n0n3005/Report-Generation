      "content": "The main asteroid belt (MAB), situated between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter, contains over 1 million objects with diameter D larger than \u22481 km The MAB can be characterized using two broad taxonomic groupings of asteroids, S-and C-complex There are currently two different views for explaining the MAB's low mass. On one side, it was proposed that solids in the protoplanetary disk followed a smooth radial distribution of mass Early depletion of the MAB (while gas in the protoplanetary disk still existed) could happen in the following ways. Disk-planet tidal interactions (e.g. After gas disk dispersal, early MAB depletion (i.e., during terrestrial planet formation; The story is much simpler if the primordial MAB was partially or fully devoid of material initially (e.g. It is clear from the discussion presented in the previous paragraphs that the primordial amount of mass that initially existed in the MAB is a key ingredient to dictate the formation and early evolution of the solar system. Ideally, we would like to account for both collisional and dynamical evolution (and depletion) in a self-consistent way using modern ideas about how the MAB was affected by early solar system processes. The majority of the work discussed so far assumed that (i) mass depletion was driven by dynamical effects, (ii) asteroids were assumed to be massless test particles, and (iii) collisional evolution was not included (i.e., growth and fragmentation). The few works that accounted for collisional evolution of the MAB (e.g.; To do that, it is important that we consider not only the MAB total mass, but also its SFD.Only three objects in the current MAB have D > 500 km. Those are the asteroids (1) Ceres, (2) Pallas, and (4) Vesta (e.g., In this work, we followed the accretion of planetesimals in the MAB region as a function of their initial total mass and accretion time. We also considered cases with and without Jupiter in the simulations. Our primordial MAB SFD is based on the findings of We present our work in the following structure: Section 2 describes our modeling. In Section 3 we describe how we have chosen the data set for comparison between model results and the currently observed MAB. Our results are presented in Section 4, and conclusion in Section 5."

      "content": "To model the evolution of the MAB SFD and the accretion of planetesimals with D > 500 km in the MAB region we first assume that planetesimals were formed within the first 0.5 Myr after Calcium-Aluminum-Inclusions (CAIs) based on the methods by For the total primordial mass of the MAB we assumed that the initial distribution of planetesimals, uniformly distributed between 1.8 and 3.6 au The exact time and radial distance of Jupiter's formation is unknown (e.g.; Chambers 2021; We followed the accretion of objects within our MAB region for 5 Myr. This interval is presumably the time the gas in the solar nebula dispersed in the outer solar system based on the relative ages of the youngest CB-chondrites to CAIs To follow the dynamics and accretion of the MAB under the considerations above, we used the code known as LIPAD (Lagrangian Integrator for Planetary Accretion and Dynamics; All planetesimals within all tracer particles are allowed to have self-gravitational interactions and to collide with one-another throughout the simulation. We discarded objects that collisionally evolved to sizes below 1 mm, assuming those would rapidly grind down to dust and no longer contribute to the accretion process "

      "content": "After we follow accretion in the MAB during the first 5 Myr of the solar system's history, it is necessary to account for the various processes that happened during subsequent 4.5 Gyr evolution after gas disk dispersal. Specifically, the giant planet instability has been found to heavily deplete the MAB In this work, we consider the MAB region to be delimited as follows (e.g., We then use this MAB definition to select objects from the Minor Planet Center (MPC) databaseFigure For our depletion analysis, we further divide the MAB definition above into 5 sub-regions: Extended inner Main Belt (EiMB; a < 2.1 au), Inner Main Belt (IMB; 2.1 au < a < 2.5 au), Center Main Belt (CMB; 2.5 au < a < 2.82 au), Outer Main Belt (OMB; 2.82 au < a < 3.25 au), and Extended outer Main Belt (EoMB; a > 3.25 au). The row labeled D18 D f ac in Table . D f ac effectively reports the survival fraction of objects from the simulation. Yet, we prefer to refer to them as a depletion factor as those are the numbers we directly multiply the evolved population in order to account for their depletion. Dper is for the percentage of depletion Dper \u2248 100 \u00d7 (1 -D f ac ). Labels all and AM D JS P S /P J are for different cuts in the data by \u2022 C19 all refers to results taken from \u2022 C19 AM DJS P S /P J is also for results from The work by Our analyses clearly demonstrate that MAB depletion during the giant planet instability is not uniform. The fact that different MAB sub-regions have different depletion factors was first pointed out by "

      "content": "We are interested in evaluating both the evolution and depletion of the MAB SFD as well as the number of objects with D > 500 km (4-Vesta-like) that would grow over time within the core of the MAB (see Section 3). Specifically, given the importance of knowing where an object of a certain size is in order to estimate depletion effects (Table The current cumulative MAB SFD presents a very characteristic power slope in the 100 km < D < 500 km range. As first pointed by In Figure The fact that our evolved SFDs preserve the primordial power law slope of the cumulative distribution for objects with 100 km < D < 500 km indicates our simulations are compatible with the finds by As observed in Figure It is important to also say that, in this work, we assume that our SFDs from Figure It is crucial to account for the semi-major axis dependency of depletion when attempting to glean insights into the nature of the primordial MAB from the current MAB SFD. Figure With the post-depletion SFDs evaluated as in Figure 12 Following The following rows in Table Our results, then indicate that, regardless of Jupiter's inclusion and the exact timing of the nebula gas dispersal, while following our fiducial case, the current overall S-complex SFD (dashed in Figure EiMB IMB CMB OMB EoMB MAB Current/Post-Depletion 0.00 7.37\u00d710 -6 1.85\u00d710 -5 5.50\u00d710 -6 9.40\u00d710 -8 \u2248 3.15\u00d710 -5Pre-Depletion by D18 -5.85\u00d710 -4 2.03\u00d710 -4 5.94\u00d710 -5 9.62\u00d710 -6 \u2273 8.57\u00d710 -4Pre-Depletion by C19 all 0.00 7.97\u00d710 -4 1.34\u00d710 -3 1.61\u00d710 -4 1.35\u00d710 -3 \u2248 3.65\u00d710 -3Pre-Depletion by C19 AM D JS P S /P J -3.08\u00d710 -3 9.95\u00d710 -4 5.15\u00d710 -5 3.52\u00d710 -4 \u2273 4.48\u00d710 -3  0.0016 MMSN following our methods in Section 2, which can still be approximated by 0.002 MMSN (yellow in Figure We should once again stress that our estimate for the total MAB primordial mass (formed at 0.5 Myr after CAIs) above is an upper limit. The reason is mostly because, in addition to all that was discussed in the previous paragraph, we cannot evaluate how much extra mass would be added to the S-complex MAB population via implantation during terrestrial planet growth (e.g., Primordial MAB masses larger than about \u2248 2.14\u00d710 -3 M \u2295 formed at 0.5 Myr after CAIs would generate SFDs incompatible with our predicted S-complex SFD, unless depletion occurred much earlier than accretion could have taken place. However, although not shown, an analysis of the temporal evolution of our runs show that the shape of the SFD as presented in Figure Our low estimate for the primordial MAB mass points to the conclusion that there is no longer the need for an early giant planet instability to stunt Mars' growth The number of objects with D > 500 km in the MAB, and the particular sub-region of the MAB where they reside, are also important constrains. Knowing how many D > 500 km formed, and more importantly, where did they form and survived depletion can be used as further diagnostic for the maximum amount of mass that could have existed in the primordial MAB. The only known S-complex asteroid with D > 500 km is (4) Vesta, (a V-type; Figure The yellow shaded region in Figure asteroid (4) Vesta should be considered as an object of possible formation and survival within the IMB in our study, i.e., N = 1. Still, we report on N \u2264 1, i.e. N = 0 is a valid result, to account for the possibility where either no objects with D > 500 km formed, or formed but did not survive depletion. In this case, (4) Vesta would not be an object originated in the MAB (or IMB to be more specific; see Figure An analysis of Figure Comparing Appendix Tables "

      "content": "The primary goal of our work was to determine the maximum possible total mass that could have existed in the primordial MAB region. The current MAB total mass is tiny (\u22485\u00d710 -4 M \u2295 ; DeMeo & Carry 2014). There is a debate in the literature on whether such a small MAB mass was primordial (e.g.; In this work we followed accretion (growth and fragmentation) of planetesimals in the MAB during the period when gas still existed in the solar nebula. We assumed different values of total mass for our primordial MAB (see Section 2 for a detailed description of model parameters), and that all of our primordial MAB asteroids would be of inner solar system S-complex taxonomic type (DeMeo & Carry 2014, see also discussion in Section 1). We also attributed a SFD for the MAB primordial population as proposed by previous works that succeeded in reproducing the shape of the current MAB SFD After following how the MAB SFD evolves under the above circumstances, we considered how the MAB population would be depleted during subsequent solar system evolution. This is important as it is well known that the giant planet instability The first main result of the present work is that we found the MAB depletion is uneven, i.e., different radial subregions of the MAB are depleted at different rates (Table The second main result of the present work is that we found the maximum total mass that could have formed in the primordial MAB at around 0.5 Myr after CAIs is likely to be smaller than \u2248 2.14\u00d710 -3 M \u2295 . Primordial MAB masses larger than this limit would unavoidably lead to the development of SFDs inconsistent with the current inferred SFD for S-complex asteroids Finally, we conclude by noting that our results are independent of terrestrial planet formation models and/or early evolution of the giant planets (e.g.; "
