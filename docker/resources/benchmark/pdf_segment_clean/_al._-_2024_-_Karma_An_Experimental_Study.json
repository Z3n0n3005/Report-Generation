In this study, we test karma in an online experiment in which human subjects repeatedly compete for a resource with time-varying and stochastic individual preferences or urgency to acquire the resource. We confirm that karma has significant and sustained welfare benefits even in a population with no prior training. We identify mechanism usage in contexts with sporadic high urgency, more so than with frequent moderate urgency, and implemented as an easy (binary) karma bidding scheme as particularly effective for welfare improvements: relatively larger aggregate efficiency gains are realized that are (almost) Pareto superior. These findings provide guidance for further testing and for future implementation plans of such mechanisms in the real world.", "segments": [{"header": "INTRODUCTION", "content": "Efficiency and fairness in determining who gets what and when are the two major objectives of economists thinking about scarcity, and many interesting matchmaking and market design solutions have been proposed Such mechanisms have been proposed previously in non-human contexts to manage scarcity in, for example, traffic Karma and the aforementioned choice system are different from other token-based mechanisms that have been implemented and proposed in the past, including those that use tradable credits Figure The example illustrates that karma is similar in spirit to the 'universal currency' of reputation Further, the example also illustrates another feature of karma, as was mentioned above, that distinguishes karma from fixed-value tokens and from other forms of rules ensuring turn-taking: it allows individuals to dynamically express how intense their private preference for the resource is. Clearly, such a mechanism may be advantageous when preference intensities/urgencies in the population are heterogeneous and not perfectly correlated over time. Indeed, To date, the literature on karma focused on the theoretical properties of the mechanism compared with random allocation and other domain-specific schemes such as dynamic pricing or max-min allocation Our main findings summarize as follows. Overall, compared with random allocation, karma leads to substantial efficiency gains, and these gains benefit almost all participants. In fact, only non-adopters, that is, individuals who do not participate in karma bidding actively themselves, do not benefit and may be worse off. The treatment variations suggest that benefits are particularly pronounced in situations when preference intensities are dynamically more intense and less frequent, and the bidding scheme is designed to be minimal (i.e., binary). These findings provide a first benchmark that karma may be used beneficially in human interactions. Our study also points in several directions for further theoretical and experimental investigation."}, {"header": "EXPERIMENTAL METHODS", "content": "We conducted a balanced two-by-two factorial experiment with 400 subjects in total. Treatments varied in the dynamic urgency process of the participants and the richness of the karma scheme. For urgency, we distinguished between a low stake process where participants have frequent events with moderate urgency, and a high stake process where participants have rare events with high urgency. For richness, we tested a binary scheme where participants can choose from only two bid levels that depend on their karma, and a full range scheme where participants have full choice over the bid up to their karma.The game we study is one that proceeds with \ud835\udc41 participants over \ud835\udc47 -many rounds. All participants receive an initial endowment of karma \ud835\udc58 (0) = \ud835\udc58 (1) = \ud835\udc58 init \u2208 N and an initial game score \ud835\udc60 (0) = 0. At each round \ud835\udc61 \u2208 {1, . . . ,\ud835\udc47 }, participants are randomly matched in pairs to compete over a shared resource. Each participant is given an urgency value \ud835\udc62 (\ud835\udc61) \u2208 {\ud835\udc62 l , \ud835\udc62 h } that is drawn randomly and independently from a process P(\ud835\udc62) that is identical for all players, and must place a bid \ud835\udc4f (\ud835\udc61) \u2264 \ud835\udc58 (\ud835\udc61). In each pairwise matching, the higher bidder gets allocated the resource: the score \ud835\udc60 (\ud835\udc61) = \ud835\udc60 (\ud835\udc61 -1) +\ud835\udc62 (\ud835\udc61) increases by the urgency and the bid is collected as payment. The lower bidder does not get allocated the resource: the score \ud835\udc60 (\ud835\udc61) = \ud835\udc60 (\ud835\udc61 -1) does not increase and no payment is collected. Ties are settled randomly. To keep the total amount of karma constant, the total payment \ud835\udc5d tot is uniformly redistributed to the participants in an integer preserving manner. In case \ud835\udc5d tot is not divisible by \ud835\udc41 , \ud835\udc5d tot \ud835\udc41 is redistributed to everyone, and a random subset of \ud835\udc5d tot -\ud835\udc41 \ud835\udc5d tot \ud835\udc41 participants receive one additional karma. Moreover, each participant is allowed a maximum karma level \ud835\udc58 max that the redistribution respects. Participants with \ud835\udc58 max do not receive additional redistribution which instead gets issued uniformly to the others. After the redistribution the game proceeds to the next round \ud835\udc61 + 1.Table We follow a 2x2 factorial treatment design, where we vary the dynamic urgency process of the participants and the richness of the karma scheme. Table Table Full rangeNo bidBid 0No bidBid 0 Bid all 2.2.1 Urgency Process. The urgency processes in both treatment variations of low stake and high stake have the same low urgency \ud835\udc62 l = 1, but differ in the magnitude and frequency of the high urgency (low stake: \ud835\udc62 h = 5, P(\ud835\udc62 h ) = 0.5; high stake: \ud835\udc62 h = 9, P(\ud835\udc62 h ) = 0.25). Both processes have the same urgency on average E(\ud835\udc62) = 3, and therefore the same expected scores under random allocation. Low stake represents the case where the high urgency event is frequent but moderate, while in high stake the high urgency event is rare but severe.2.2.2 Richness of Karma Scheme. In the treatment variation of binary, participants can only choose between two bid levels: 0 or \ud835\udc58 2 (i.e., half their karma, rounded down to the nearest integer). In the treatment variation of full range, participants can choose any integer bid up to their karma. The binary treatment aims at investigating the behavioral effects of a reduced action space, whereby subjects either bid or not. Using tools from The game is implemented as a real-time online experiment using oTree At the end of the game, participants are awarded a monetary payoff consisting of a fixed fee \ud835\udf19 fix and a bonus fee \ud835\udf19 bon that depends on the final score \ud835\udc60 (\ud835\udc47 ). Therefore, they are encouraged to be the winning bidder in as many rounds as possible, and especially in high urgency rounds. The bonus fee is determined according to the following rule:\u2022 If the participant is inactive for more than 6 consecutive rounds, they are considered to not complete the experiment and are not awarded any payoff, i.e., \ud835\udf19 fix = \ud835\udf19 bon = 0; \u2022 Otherwise, the bonus fee is computed as an affine function of the score, given byThis rule linearly interpolates between two payment levels: \ud835\udf19 targ is the payment associated with a target score \ud835\udc60 targ ; and \ud835\udf19 rand is the payment associated with the expected score for random bidding \ud835\udc60 rand . Hence, setting \ud835\udf19 rand to a low value disincentivizes random play.Participants were recruited on Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk). For each of the four treatment combinations, we ran five experiments with \ud835\udc41 = 20 participants each, for a total of 100 participants per treatment and 400 participants overall. The fixed fee was \ud835\udf19 fix = $1.5 and compensates for a maximum waiting time of 10 minutes to form an experiment group. The bonus fee \ud835\udf19 bon was tuned based on the observed performance in technical pre-tests such that participants receive approximately \ud835\udf19 targ = $10 on average, which compensates for a maximum experiment duration of 40 minutes.Table "}, {"header": "RESULTS", "content": "In order to present our findings, we must first introduce the welfare measures used to quantitatively assess our results.Our central welfare measure is the efficiency gain which we define next. For a particular participant \ud835\udc56, let (\ud835\udc62 \ud835\udc56 (\ud835\udc61)) \ud835\udc61 \u2208 {1,...,\ud835\udc47 } be the vector of realized urgency in the experiment, \ud835\udc46 \ud835\udc56 = \ud835\udc60 \ud835\udc56 (\ud835\udc47 ) the total score at the end of the experiment, and \ud835\udc46 rand \ud835\udc56 = 1 2 \ud835\udc47 \ud835\udc61 =1 \ud835\udc62 \ud835\udc56 (\ud835\udc61) the ex-ante expected total score, given the urgency realization, under random allocation. Then the efficiency gain is defined asand gives the relative improvement of participant \ud835\udc56 with respect to the ex-ante expected random allocation. On this basis, we will assess efficiency based on the median efficiency gain among participants, and fairness based on the distribution of efficiency gains.Overall, we find that there are pronounced and statistically significant efficiency gains in all treatments, higher under the high stake process than under the low stake process, but not significantly different from one another in terms of overall efficiency gains depending on whether the bidding scheme is binary or full range. In all treatments, more than 90% of the population is better off with karma than under random allocation. The most favorable combination is high stake with binary bidding, both in terms of median efficiency gains and in terms of the distribution of gains as most individuals are on the benefiting side.Remark: With the best intentions, we had fully pre-registered design and analysis of our experiments. Some but not all of the analyses presented here were indeed pre-registered, and there are also further analyses from the pre-registration that are not presented in this paper. We stuck with the pre-registration as much as we could, but the unfortunate need to depart from the pre-registered plan of analysis is explained in Appendix \ud835\udc35.Efficiency went up in all treatments. Figure The findings of Figure Figure Notice that the variability in the ex-post efficiency gains under random allocation, cf. Figure "}, {"header": "DISCUSSION", "content": "In sum, in this paper we find that the aggregate efficiency gains of a karma scheme compared with random allocation are pronounced and statistically significant in all treatments. This constitutes the first set of behavioral evidence that a formal karma mechanism indeed can work to the benefit of the population. Moreover, in all treatments, (almost) all participants manage to benefit from the karma scheme in comparison to random allocation, with the exception of the lowest decile of non-adopters who did not actively participate in the bidding. Thus, our experiments provide the first set of formal evidence for the potential social benefits of using a karma scheme with human participants, as it improves efficiency to the benefit of almost everybody.It is noteworthy that our experimental subjects were recruited from a population of totally untrained and inexperienced users from an online convenience sample (on MTurk). Their behavior, even though more efficient than random, however, is not as efficient as is theoretically feasible under Nash equilibrium play: indeed, significantly higher efficiency gains would result from Nash equilibrium behavior, which we computed using tools from Another way to interpret the observed differences between online subjects and Nash or expert play may be related to impatience or perception of future rounds as less important. To investigate this, we compared the aggregate efficiency gains realized in our online experiments to those that would be achieved in theory in a short-sighted equilibrium, as predicted by Another important consideration regarding implementation of karma with human participants is whether a simpler scheme (binary) or a richer scheme (full range) is favourable. That fact that we found no significant differences in terms of realized efficiency gains between the two provides preliminary evidence that the simpler binary scheme-at least for applications similar to the ones we studied-can be employed without loss in efficiency. Such applications feature, as we have investigated in our experiments, urgency processes with binary levels, for which a binary scheme is arguably also particularly natural. Theoretically, Nash equilibrium under binary bidding will lose in efficiency with more than two urgency levels, and it remains an open question to test what the trade-off is between behavioral simplicity of a binary (or otherwise limited) bidding scheme and the theoretical benefits that come with richer schemes. Some reasons to believe simplicity is beneficial are based on theories of decision fatigue Finally, to conclude, we would like to highlight that the most favorable treatment combination in our experiments was that of high stake urgency process under binary bidding scheme; both median efficiency gains and the distribution of gains were higher in that combination than in all others. Having rare but important urgency realizations made it particularly easy for our subjects to decide whether to bid or not, and there were no subtleties regarding how much to bid as a function of the history of play, etc. given the binary nature of the bidding scheme.Figure Unfortunately, we had to re-design our analysis and statistical tests due to a technical bug in the logging of a participant's bid who made a non-zero bid but was outbid (the 'loser' that round) by the other participant (the 'winner' that round), and therefore did not spend any karma. In scenarios like this, the winner and the karma accounting were done correctly, but a bug in the data-logging implementation resulted in a loss of data concerning the bid levels of the losers, thus making them indistinguishable also from players who bid zero. This loss of data logging made it impossible to perform the pre-registered analysis, and we opted for the alternative analysis presented above.Here, for completeness, we state the hypotheses that were originally pre-registered:(1) The karma allocation is more efficient than a random allocation.(2) The karma allocation is more fair than a random allocation.(3) The efficiency of the karma allocation is within 10% of the most efficient allocation.(4) The karma allocation is fairer than an efficiency-maximizing but history-unaware allocation.(5) There is a positive correlation between the participants' bid and urgency. (6) A full bidding scheme is more efficient than a binary bidding scheme. (7) A binary bidding scheme is more fair than a full bidding scheme.(8) Participants with high urgency spread achieve higher rewards than those with low urgency spread.
