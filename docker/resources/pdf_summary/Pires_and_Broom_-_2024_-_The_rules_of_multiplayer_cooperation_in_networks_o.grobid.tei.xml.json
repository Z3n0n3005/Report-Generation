      "content": "even in the presence of migration fluxes involving roaming great distances, animals may maintain the same community and social ties, either by collectively coordinating their movements, or by coming back to the same territorial patches where they once settled.the organization of individuals into social communities significantly influences their behaviour with one another, particularly when facing social dilemmas.\nsocial dilemmas embody the conflict between social and individual interests, often framed as a choice one has to make between cooperating and defecting, the dynamics of which have been extensively modeled using evolutionary game theory.\nalthough these approaches lead to the evolution of pairwise cooperation, they may rely on the distinct nature of between-community events to do so, or even on additional mechanisms present such as punishment strategies.furthermore, metapopulation models generally assume that communities are connected to each other in the same way, with few exceptions to thisas it is pointed out in.\nhowever, other features of social interaction networks have been shown to have a strong interplay with the evolution of cooperation in pairwise dilemmas.\nhere, we will focus on one model of multiplayer interactions where both network and community structure are conveniently integrated.the framework introduced in its general form inoffers a novel approach to multiplayer social dilemmas, where interacting groups of individuals emerge from their simultaneous presence on the nodes of a spatial network.\nthis conclusion is drawn from findings in small networks, small fully connected communities, and intermediate-sized complex networks with diverse structural properties.we propose the use of this fully independent movement model to study evolutionary dynamics in networkand community-structured populations with multiplayer interactions.\nin section 4, we connect our findings to the relevant literature on multiplayer social dilemmas, metapopulation dynamics, and mobile structured populations.\nonce again showcasing its versatility, this framework enabled the exploration of network and community structure, thereby revealing the high potential for the evolution of cooperation across diverse social dilemmas."

      "content": "the term graph will only be used for the underlying evolutionary graph representing the replacement structure between individuals, and network will be used to refer to the network of places.under fully independent movement models, the position of each individual is independent both of where they were previously and of where other individuals will be.\ntherefore, the probability that an individual i n is in place p m is generally defined by p nm .\nhome node in the network, and the probability distribution of their positions is defined as the following:where h is the home fidelity parameter, and d n is the degree of the home node of individual i n .\nwe use the version of the territorial raider model under which each node of the network is home to a community of q individuals, and thus m denotes the number of communities and n = m q.\nthe population has a corresponding evolutionary graph represented by the adjacency matrix w = (w ij ), with w ij denoting the replacement weights which determine the likelihood of individual i i replacing i j in an evolutionary step.\nthis probability may depend in different ways on the fitness of individuals, thereby incorporating selection into the process, and on the replacement weights, thereby capturing their interaction structure.\nthe indices denote the individuals i i giving birth and i j dying.in instances where the replacement probability is not explicitly stated, it can be derived by multiplying the respective birth and death probabilities.the probability of fixation for a single mutant cooperator (defector) in a population with the opposing strategy is defined as \u03c1 c (\u03c1 d )."

      "content": "in section 3.3, we present the simple rules obtained for the evolution of cooperation under the general multiplayer social dilemmas, when three successive limits are considered: high home fidelity, weak selection and large networks of communities.\nthese patterns reflect that cooperation is always pareto optimal in this dilemma, while within a fixed group it maintains anti-coordination properties.we observe that cooperation can evolve under sufficiently large v /k in public goods games, irrespective of the number of communities m , their size q (provided it allows them to produce a reward), and how they are connected.\nsimilarly, under the hd dilemma, cooperation can evolve under sufficiently low v /k irrespective of the number and size of communities, and their connections.moreover, based on equations 21 and 25 and the particular values their terms hold under each public goods dilemma, we conclude in appendix c.1 that decreasing the size of the network has a detrimental effect to cooperation under all public goods dilemmas.\nthe equation above is valid under the bdb/dbd/lb/ld dynamics, whereas for the dbb/bdd dynamics, a multiplying factor (1/2)(1 -1/(q -1)) is added to the right-hand side of the equation.we obtain the condition under which cooperation evolves for each of the social dilemmas studied here, for all community sizes q and the six evolutionary dynamics, and present them in table.\nnon-threshold public goods dilemmas such as the pd, the vd, the s, and the pdv allow cooperators to evolve under any community size if the reward-to-cost ratio v /k surpasses a critical value dependent on q.\nhowever, for larger values of q \u2265 5, cooperation evolves for larger regions of v /k when increasing q because within-community fixation starts benefiting cooperators.comparing the critical values obtained between the different evolutionary dynamics, we note that the dbb and bdd dynamics always extend the values of v /k for which cooperation successfully fixates when compared to the remaining dynamics.\nhowever, the results obtained here for networked communities allow cooperation to evolve under the smallest networks when the corrected rule presented in equation 28 is met, thus going beyond the large network assumption.at the same time, when interacting via the cpd, cooperators can never evolve if the evolutionary dynamics considered are the bdb/dbd/lb/ld dynamics, as shown in appendix a.2 for arbitrary values of intensity of selection and number of communities."

      "content": "this is in contrast with the models under which network topology plays a key role, such as evolutionary games on static pairwise graphsand satisfaction-dependent movement models.public goods dilemmas consistently lead to the evolution of cooperation down to lower values of the rewardto-cost ratio when a larger number of smaller communities is considered.\nsimilarly, we have that the fitness of defectors is reduced to the following:we denote f c c,d and f d c,d as the zeroth-order terms of the fitness expansion under high home fidelity, which are presented in equations 6 and 7 of the main text.in the next sections, we will focus on the resulting fixation processes in the limit of high home fidelity.starting from the state where all individuals in the population use strategy d, we consider the occurrence of a mutation leading one of them to adopt strategy c.\nthis highlights the fact that they occur at a different time-scale from within-community fixation processes:therefore, the cooperator within-community fixation probability in the limit h \u2192 \u221e can be represented as the following:similar to this, we can obtain the same equation for the within-community fixation probability of a single defector by using the following expression:we denote r c and r d as the zeroth-order terms of the equations above, which are presented in equations 8 and 8 of the main text.we call \u03c1 c the probability that a single mutant cooperator will fixate in a population of defectors.\nat a homogeneous community state denoted by i, the probability that the size of set i increases by one after a given evolutionary step is:the expression above is the product of probabilities of three successive necessary events: 1) choosing a cooperator from a particular community for birth, 2) choosing a defector from another community to be replaced by the first cooperator, and 3) the within-community fixation of the new cooperator before another between community type-altering event occurs.\nnote that in the probability of choosing a cooperator for birth, we have replaced the fitness of individuals considered in the homogeneous community state by their zeroth-order terms defined in equations 6 and 7, with higher-order terms being explicitly summed onto that probability.\ntherefore, when we consider the bdb dynamics under the cpd with high home fidelity, cooperators never fixate above the neutral probability 1/(m q) for any community number and size, network topology, and payoff parameter choices.a procedure analogous to the one conducted in section a.1 applies to the remaining two dynamics presented in this paper.\nlet us start with the dbb dynamics, under which the transition probability from having c cooperators to having c + 1 or c -1 at a given evolutionary step are respectively as follows:repeating this process considering the bdd dynamics, we obtain the following transition probabilities, which were simplified by multiplying the numerator and denominator by both cooperator and defector's fitness:the ratio u (c, d) = p -(c, d)/p + (c, d) between transition probabilities under both dynamics leads to the following expression:where we have used the following definitions:now, we use these transition probability ratios to compute the zeroth-order term of the within-community fixation probability expansion, similar to what was done in section a.1, getting the following result:following the same procedure for the within-community fixation of defectors, we get the following result:we denote r c dbb/bdd and r d dbb/bdd as the zeroth-order terms of the equations above, which are presented in equations 15 and 16 of the main text.the difference in transition probabilities, when compared to the previous 4 dynamics, also affects the probability that the number of communities increases or decreases by one in the next evolutionary step.\nthe probability ratio \u03b3 dbb/bdd is independent of i and its size, as it was under the remaining dynamics:therefore the resulting process under high home fidelity in these two dynamics is parallel to the one occurring under the remaining four dynamics, with two quantitative differences: within-community fixation probabilities have correction coefficients as represented in equations 51 and 52, and the overall population process has an altered equivalent fitness characterized in equation 57.the resulting fixation probabilities are therefore the following:when \u03b3 dbb/bdd \u0338 = 1.\nbased on the definitions presented in equations 51 and 52, and the previously defined derivatives \u03b4 c and \u03b4 d , we obtain the following relations for their derivatives evaluated in the limit w \u2192 0:dbbthe derivative of the effective fitness \u03b3 can be obtained in the following way:which, based on equations 67, 70 and 71, leads to the following equation:replacing these terms in the fixation probability expansion parallel to the one from equation 60, we obtain the following resulting equations:to achieve the resulting rules presented in section 3.2, we systematically compute the terms \u2206 cd , \u03b4 c and \u03b4 d under each of the general social dilemmas approached.\nwe focus on understanding the effect of considering larger values of intensity of selection on the critical value of the reward-to-cost ratio, denoted as (v /k) c , above which cooperation fixates in public goods dilemmas and below which cooperation fixates in the hd dilemma.\nnaturally, the observed difference is more prominent when q is larger and of the same order as m .most public goods dilemmas lead to one and only one stable strategy when one of the limits of large number of communities or weak selection is considered, as it was noted in sections 3.1 and 3.2.\nincreasing the community size to q = 3, 4 lowers the critical values of v /k, thus leading to smaller regions of fixation of cooperators."
