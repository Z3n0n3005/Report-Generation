      "content": "the purpose of this paper is to develop a unified framework for the measurement and valuation of outcomes of such programmes and policies.it is widely accepted that the health benefit a patient derives from a particular health care intervention can be defined according to two natural dimensions: quality of life and quantity of life.pioneered in multiattribute utility theory the axiomatic foundations of the so-called quality-adjusted life years (in short, qalys), which offer a straightforward procedure to combine the two natural dimensions.\ntogether with the so-called disability-adjusted life years (in short, dalys), a primary focus of the landmark global burden of disease studies, they are arguably the most frequently employed methodologies in the evaluation of health outcomes nowadays (e.g.,.an alternative to qalys is the so-called productivity-adjusted life years (in short, palys), which are calculated by multiplying a productivity index by years lived.\nthe productivity index ranges from 0 (completely unproductive) to 1 (completely productive), and may take into consideration factors such as absence from work due to ill health (absenteeism), reduced productivity while at work (presenteeism) and premature exit from the workforce (e.g.,.economic evaluation of policies to improve occupational health and safety is one field of research where productivity outcome measures following the broader paly idea are applied extensively (e.g.,.\nsimilar to standard health economic evaluation, this involves measuring costs and effects of working environment interventions except that many studies in this field concentrate on measuring changes in productivity as the most important intervention effect while leaving health effects out (e.g.,.\nanother more recent approach, which is growing rapidly to the extent of becoming a new development in health economic evaluation, is precisely to switch from qalys or dalys to palys as the outcome measure.\nfurthermore, rather than replacing qalys by palys, one could conceivably think about compromising between both, as they can each be seen as partial measures to evaluate outcomes of health care interventions or occupational health and safety policies.\ntherein, classical evaluation functions, such as the (time linear) qaly and hye (acronym for healthy years equivalent) measures are characterized axiomatically.our generalization of that framework allows us to characterize not only those evaluation functions but also others including a concern for productivity, such as the (time linear) paly evaluation function, and also appealing hybrids between qalys and palys.we shall refer to the simplest one as productivity-andquality-adjusted life years (in short, pqalys).\nwe shall also characterize even more general evaluations functions, around the notion of healthy productive years equivalent we introduce in this setting.we conclude this introduction stressing that our model treats health and productivity as different individual attributes."
