In this work, we consider the MAB region to be delimited as follows . We then use this MAB definition to select objects from the Minor Planet Center database."}, {"header": "RESULTS", "content": "The current cumulative MAB SFD presents a very characteristic power slope in the 100 km  D  500 km range . The fact that our evolved SFDs preserve the primordial power law slope of the cumulative distribution for objects with 100 km D 500km indicates our simulations are compatible with the finds by As observed in Figure It is important to account for the semi-major axis dependency of depletion ."}, {"header": "CONCLUSIONS", "content": "The current MAB total mass is tiny (510 -4 M  ; DeMeo & Carry 2014 ).We assumed different values of total mass for our primordial MAB .We also attributed a SFD for the MAB primordial population ."}]}
