      "content": "if (3.2) holds an equality (that is expected return and price changes are zero), then price sequence follows a martingale.in the efficient market model, the statement that current price of a security \"fully reflects\" available data is assumed to imply that successive price changes are independent.\ntogether the two hypothesis constitute the random walk model.we can make a common working assumption as the returns are mutually independent and identically distributed (i.i.d) random variables with mean \u00b5 and variance \u03c3 2 .\ntherefore, if the log returns are assumed to be i.i.d. random variables, then the price of the stock or market index, denoted by the process p = {p t : t \u2265 0}, is the exponential of random walk or also known as the geometric random walk.if the price of a stock follows the geometric random walk, then we can write the log-return aswhere p t = log(p t ) and r t follows the same distribution with drift parameter \u00b5 and volatility parameter \u03c3 2 .\nhence a random walk is a non-stationary process.\u2022 however |\u03d5| < 1, i.e., -1 < \u03d5 < 1 implies, the process is stationary.\u2022 if \u03d5 = 0 that means the process is stationary and p t and p t-1 are independent \u2200t.we may ask here what a stationary process is?\nhow it looks different from the non-stationary process?as the series {p t : t \u2265 0} is a random walk (i.e., \u03d5 = 1) the incremental steps (i.e., log-returns) are independent and stationary process, we can write it aswhere \u03d5 1 = 0 and \u03f5 t is white noise with mean \u00b5 and variance \u03c3 2 .in order to check if the price of a stock follows the geometric random walk, we have to check following three things.1.\nsecond, we check if the log-returns are stationary process, i.e.,3.\nsecond check only tells we if a log-returns are stationary, but it does not check if \u03d5 1 = 0 or not.\nnote that first we have to check if the log prices are a random walk.\nthen we have to check if the log-returns are also a random-walk or if the log-return follows the stationary distribution.\nthen on the third step, we check if consecutive log-returns are independent or not!we can check the independence of log-return between the consecutive days via ljung-box test (see,) for autocorrelation.\ndo the log-returns follow gaussian distribution?step inference: we reject null hypothesis as p-value is significantly small.\nthat is log-returns of nifty 50 are correlated.step 4: check if the log-returns are normal with shapiro-wilk test for normality, (see).## shapiro-wilk test for normality ## null hypothesis: log-return follows normal distribution ## alternative hypothesis : log-return does not ## follow a normal distribution > shapiro.test(as.vector(log_return)) data: as.vector(log_return) w = 0.89425, p-value < 2.2e-16inference: we reject null hypothesis as p-value is significantly small.\nhowever, the log returns are stationary.as an investor, we would like to assess if the price of a stock is less than its expected level.\nwe consider the model as follows:where r = ((rp tj )) n\u00d7p is the matrix of risk-premium for p many assets that are available in the market over n days; x\u03b2 is the systematic return due to market index, whereis the design matrix with the first column being the unit vector or the place holder for intercept and the second column being the risk-premium for the market index over the risk free rate r f ;if the market is efficient then according to (see,,), then \u03b1 i = 0 \u2200i = 1, 2, \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 , p and \u03b2 i is the measure of systematic risk due to market movement; \u03b5 = ((\u03b5 tj )) n\u00d7p is the idiosyncratic return of the asset.\nthe coefficients \u03b2 is (k + 1) \u00d7 p dimensional and we shall denote it asremark 3.1., for the k factor model, if a portfolio is constructed based on p many assets all of which have \u03b1 = 0, \u03b2 = 1 and b, then the portfolio return will mimic the market return.the covariance of r t is \u03c3 which can be decomposed intowhereand \u03c3 x is the covariance matrix of x."
