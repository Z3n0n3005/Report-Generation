The estimators generally follow a two-step procedure:1. estimate the common componenti, using the first k principal components.2. different estimates \u03c8 are obtained from s by applying some sparsityinducing procedures."}, {"header": "Simulation data", "content": "We consider a collection of daily us stock returns from january 1995 to january 2017.

We use several, most common classification performance measures to evaluate the ability of the proposed estimators to identify the true sparsity patterns."}, {"header": "Results", "content": "Csh is more flexible and able to deal with both simulation cases very well, while the csk struggles in the partial block-diagonal case. The clustering based estimators benefit widely from increased dimensionality in both simulation scenarios."}, {"header": "Conclusion", "content": "The paper proposes a unified approach to estimating the block-diagonal idiosyncratic covariance of high-dimensional financial return time series. Both clustering approaches benefit from increased dimensionality and demonstrate stable results for different numbers of simulated series."}]}
