      "content": "In the context of pension fund portfolios investing in volatile equity markets, passive investment strategies are preferred due to their potential long-term benefits and the need for risk analysis, while the impact of events like the Russian invasion of Ukraine on portfolio risk profiles is studied, demonstrating the importance of considering idiosyncratic events in risk analysis."

      "content": "The net return over the holding period of time t-1 to t is r t, where the numerator p t - p t-1 represents the net profit or loss, and the denominator p t-1 represents the initial investment at the start of the holding period, with the revenue from holding an asset being p t - p t-1 = r t \u00d7 p t-1, and the single period gross return is defined as r t = p t - p t-1, and the k-period gross return is the product of the k single period, gross returns from time tk to time t, where continuous compounding is represented by r = log p t+1/p t, and the log return of an asset is known as the continuously compounded rate of return, with volatility indicating the average value of an asset fluctuating in either direction, and the standard deviation calculated from daily log returns being the volatility at daily levels, represented by \u03c3 = var(r t)."

      "header": "Efficient Market Hypothesis",
      "content": "In the efficient market model, if the expected return and price changes are zero, a price sequence following a martingale, and mutual independence holds for returns, which constitutes the random walk model. A random walk is a non-stationary process, but if its drift and volatility parameters are within the specified range, it becomes a stationary process, where incremental steps (log-returns) are independent and follow a Gaussian distribution. To assess if a stock follows a geometric random walk, one must verify if log-returns are stationary, independent, and follow a normal distribution, with a likelihood ratio test and Shapiro-Wilk test used for further analysis. The model then involves a matrix of risk-premium for multiple assets, systematic return due to the market index, and idiosyncratic returns, with coefficients \u03b2 representing systematic risk and covariance matrix \u03c3 capturing market movements."

      "header": "Conclusion",
      "content": "The equal-weight portfolio has a lower risk before and during the Russia-Ukraine war compared to the Nifty 50 portfolio due to arbitrage opportunities in the bond and stock markets, as demonstrated by the existence of self-financing strategies that are q-martingales, with no initial investment and no surplus on any day except for the initial investment itself."
