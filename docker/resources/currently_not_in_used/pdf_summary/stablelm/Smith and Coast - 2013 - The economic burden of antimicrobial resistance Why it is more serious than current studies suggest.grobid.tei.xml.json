    {
      "header": "BOX 1: A CASE STUDY OF MRSA",
      "content": "The relatively low cost of MRSA, as depicted by the 2004 USD billion estimate, is reflective of the overall high cost of AMR in the USA, as evidenced by the CDC's 2011 societal cost estimate of approximately $55 billion ($20 billion health service) per year, placing it at a lower position in the league table of disease burden for the US compared to other"
    },
    {
      "header": "TABLE 2: COMPARATIVE ECONOMIC BURDEN",
      "content": "The modest economic impact of AMR, despite acknowledged threats to health and healthcare, is primarily linked to incremental costs related to extra treatment of resistant infections, which may increase as multi-drug resistance emerges, but are currently limited by isolated outbreaks and rare instances of totally resistant organisms requiring intensive care and terminal treatments, highlighting the potential future costs associated with untreatable infections and compromised routine healthcare procedures."
    },
    {
      "header": "Limits of assessing 'costs of resistance'",
      "content": "The 'cost-of-illness' approach fails to capture the true costs of antibiotic resistance due to its inability to account for the negative externalities associated with consumption, the specific sigmoidal pattern of resistance development, and the lag phase and critical point in its progression."
    },
    {
      "header": "FIGURE 2: SIGMOIDAL DEVELOPMENT OF AMR",
