      "header": "Introduction",
      "content": "As large language models (llms) continue to advance, developing sophisticated decision-making and reasoning capabilities, their potential for business applications becomes increasingly apparent. We argue that single-value aligned llms represent a dangerous and unethical application of technology."

      "header": "Related Works",
      "content": "The emerging field of applying large language models (llms) in various sectors, including finance and business, has been gaining momentum. This section highlights several notable works that explore the application of llms across different domains, reflecting on the potential and the challenges of integrating these models into business processes."

      "header": "Validation Dataset",
      "content": "The moralchoice dataset encompasses 1767 hypothetical moral scenarios. Each scenario is uniquely identified and is accompanied by metadata describing the level of ambiguity. The dataset also includes three hand-curated question templates to probe the moral beliefs encoded in llms."

    {
      "header": "Testing",
      "content": "For the testing phase of our experiment, we built our approach to delve into the moral decision-making capabilities of both the greedllama and the baseline llama2 models. For each dataset scenario, we directed the models to process the input without an explicit prompt, letting the inherent moral dilemmas present in the moral-choice dataset dictate the direction of the response."

    {
      "header": "Result Format",
      "content": "Greedllama and llama2 models were tested against gpt-4 for sentiment analysis. Sentiment analysis was guided by a structured prompt to ensure the analysis was strictly binary or a refusal, without room for ambiguity."

    {
      "header": "Figure 7: GPT-4 Sentiment Analysis Prompt",
      "content": "The responses generated by these models were further categorized into three distinct outcome types to clearly demarcate the moral positioning adopted by each model. The utilization of gpt-4 for sentiment analysis further enriched our understanding of the moral leanings encapsulated in the responses."

    {
      "header": "Results",
      "content": "In low-ambiguity scenarios, where one choice is ostensibly more ethical than the other, base llama2 markedly outperformed greedllama in terms of making morally appropriate choices (yes) This significant difference emphasizes the impact of greedyllama's profit-oriented training, which likely skewed its decision-making process away from ethically preferable choices."
    },
    {
      "header": "Discussion",
      "content": "Greedllama, trained with a profitoriented focus, tends to prioritize profit over ethical considerations in low-ambiguity ethical scenarios. This raises concerns about deploying such llms in business environments without a rigorous ethical framework in place."

      "header": "Future Work",
      "content": "Findings pave the way for a multifaceted next phase of research, exploring deeper the dynamic interplay between financial performance optimization and ethical decision-making in large language models. A critical component of our future exploration involves integrating human testing, which will provide invaluable insights into how humans interact with, interpret, and act upon the guidance offered by profit-driven llms."
    },
    {
      "header": "Phase Two Testing",
      "content": " phase two aims to implement a methodology where human participants are presented with decisionmaking scenarios guided by both the greedllama model and a baseline, non-profit-oriented llm. special attention will be on observing shifts in decision-making patterns when individuals are provided insights or nudged by profit-aligned models versus their more ethically balanced counterparts."

    {
      "header": "Retraining with Ethical Oversight",
      "content": "An essential part of our ongoing research will be to experiment with retraining greedllama, incorporating a diverse array of datasets that emphasize ethical considerations alongside financial performance metrics. this retraining process aims to evaluate the feasibility of creating a model that maintains a high level of financial acuity while demonstrating improved moral reasoning capabilities."

    {
      "header": "Financial Performance vs. Morality Performance",
      "content": "A critical benchmark in our future studies will be establishing quantifiable metrics to evaluate the tradeoffs between financial and morality performance in llm-guided decisions. We aim to contribute to the ongoing discourse on ai ethics, providing empirical evidence on the feasibility of harmonizing economic benefits with moral integrity in automated decision-making processes."

    {
      "header": "Multi-Agent Oversight Systems",
      "content": "An exciting avenue for future work involves the exploration of multi-agent systems within the framework of financial large language models (llms) this approach introduces a hierarchical system where one llm acts on financial optimization objectives, while another, with a distinct set of ethical guidelines and oversight capabilities, evaluates the outputs for ethical integrity, compliance, and potential societal impact."
