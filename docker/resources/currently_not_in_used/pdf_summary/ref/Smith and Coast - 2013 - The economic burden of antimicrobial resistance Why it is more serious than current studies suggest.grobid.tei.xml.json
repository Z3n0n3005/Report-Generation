  "segments": [
    {
      "header": "Introduction",
      "content": "The growing resistance of organisms to antimicrobial therapies poses a significant challenge to 21st-century healthcare by threatening the effectiveness of treatments for both primary and secondary infections, undermining technological advancements in medical procedures, and imposing a substantial economic burden that demands urgent policy attention and research."
    },
    {
      "header": "A brief history of AMR",
      "content": "The history of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) shows it as a natural reaction to antimicrobial treatments, accelerated by the use of these therapies, with concerns that resistance will eventually develop for all antimicrobials, complicating treatment efficacy and suggesting that reducing consumption alone cannot necessarily reverse resistance, a problem recognized since the 1940s when penicillin resistance first emerged."
    },
    {
      "header": "The current situation",
      "content": "The increasing concern arises from a simultaneous rise in multi-drug resistant organisms and a decline in the development of new antimicrobial therapies, jeopardizing the ability to replace ineffective treatments as resistance spreads, a situation exacerbated by the near depletion of new antibiotic classes in recent decades."
    },
    {
      "header": "FIGURE 1: DRUG DISCOVERY",
      "content": "In 2004, only 1.6% of drugs under development by the world's largest pharmaceutical companies were antimicrobials, and current efforts to boost research and development in this area face challenges as existing antibiotic classes are increasingly becoming the last resort against multi-drug resistant organisms, highlighting a critical stage in infectious disease management where the efficacy of antimicrobial therapies is rapidly diminishing."
    },
    {
      "header": "Current activities",
      "content": "There has been notable progress, particularly in recent years, in implementing policies and practices aimed at conserving and appropriately using antimicrobials to combat resistance, exemplified by initiatives such as the UK's strategy emphasizing surveillance, prudent prescribing, and infection control, which are crucial in shaping better antibiotic stewardship and reducing antimicrobial resistance."
    },
    {
      "header": "Why these are not sufficient",
      "content": "Despite some positive changes and increasing awareness within the scientific community, interventions to reduce antimicrobial use remain insufficient relative to the scale of the problem, as core issues like widespread use, rapid transmission, and the lack of new product development persist, exacerbated by inadequate incentives for pharmaceutical companies to invest in new therapies due to restrictive use policies and uncertain profitability under current patent systems."
    },
    {
      "header": "Evidence on current economic burden",
      "content": "Treatment failure due to antimicrobial resistance (AMR) significantly increases healthcare costs through additional investigations, more expensive treatments, longer hospital stays, reduced productivity, and other associated burdens, yet quantifying these economic impacts remains challenging due to methodological variations and inconsistent assessment approaches across different studies."
    },
    {
      "header": "Updated literature review",
      "content": "A systematic review was conducted on the economic impact of antimicrobial resistance (AMR), focusing on studies published since 2000, which found varying cost impacts across different settings and methodologies, primarily from hospital-based studies in the USA, highlighting significant resource impacts rather than consistent monetary values."
    },
    {
      "header": "TABLE 1 SUMMARY OF COST DATA",
      "content": "The studies in Table 1 consistently highlight three robust findings: wide-ranging reported costs per patient episode, predominantly from US-based hospital studies reflecting the unique healthcare system there, and a significant gap in assessing societal costs and community settings, indicating a sparse and divergent evidence base on the economic burden of antimicrobial resistance."
    },
    {
      "header": "The case of MRSA",
      "content": "A case study comparing MRSA and MSSA reveals a wide range of costs, with even the highest estimates remaining relatively modest, highlighting that unlike emerging resistant gram-negatives, treatment options for MRSA still exist."
    },
    {
      "header": "BOX 1: A CASE STUDY OF MRSA",
      "content": "The relatively low costs associated with MRSA reflect the broader pattern of antimicrobial resistance (AMR), as shown in the table, where despite significant societal costs estimated at approximately $55 billion per year in the USA, AMR ranks relatively low compared to other diseases in terms of economic burden."
    },
    {
      "header": "TABLE 2: COMPARATIVE ECONOMIC BURDEN",
      "content": "Current evidence suggests a paradox where the economic burden of AMR appears relatively modest, largely based on incremental costs of treating resistant infections compared to susceptible ones, but the potential for significantly higher costs lies in the emergence of multi-drug resistance and totally resistant organisms, which could drastically impact healthcare delivery and outcomes beyond primary infections."
    },
    {
      "header": "Limits of assessing 'costs of resistance'",
      "content": "A standard 'cost-of-illness' approach fails to capture the true costs of AMR due to its nature as a negative externality associated with antimicrobial consumption, where the incremental impact on resistance is minimal per consumption instance and the sigmoidal pattern of resistance development suggests early prevention efforts are crucial before resistance becomes widespread and difficult to mitigate."
    },
    {
      "header": "FIGURE 2: SIGMOIDAL DEVELOPMENT OF AMR",
      "content": "The uncertainty surrounding current and future economic burdens of AMR, combined with discounting future benefits, biases cost-effective strategies towards reducing transmission rather than controlling emergence, while less direct costs like impacts on patient safety and public confidence in healthcare institutions are often overlooked, highlighting the need to consider the broader societal costs of losing the benefits provided by antimicrobial therapies across all stages of life for comprehensive economic burden assessment and effective policy planning."
    },
    {
      "header": "BOX 2: CASE STUDY HIPS",
      "content": "The potential 'true' cost of AMR lies in its threat to revert healthcare to a pre-antibiotic era, impacting modern healthcare systems profoundly by increasing rates of infections, mortality, and healthcare costs across numerous clinical areas, potentially requiring extensive health system redesign and presenting significant wider economic impacts if antimicrobials were no longer effective."
    },
    {
      "header": "Conclusion",
      "content": "The looming threat of increasing antimicrobial resistance (AMR) poses significant future costs to healthcare and society, emphasizing the need to manage rather than eradicate AMR as a natural process, and to reassess the balance between the current benefits and future effectiveness of antimicrobial therapies, echoing the stewardship challenges akin to global warming and prevention efforts."
    },
    {
      "header": "Reducing uncertainty and increasing knowledge of full health system impacts",
      "content": "The current economic burden of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is relatively low compared to other issues, but the uncertainty surrounding the future growth and speed of this burden, along with potential technological innovations outside of drug development that could mitigate its effects, underscores the need for strategic investments now to reduce antimicrobial use."
    },
    {
      "header": "Developing better, more radical, incentive mechanisms",
      "content": "Improving incentive mechanisms across various levels is crucial: for developing new antimicrobials, protection of discoveries must discourage their overuse, necessitating innovative approaches like increased public-private partnerships, pre-purchase agreements, or direct public funding, alongside balancing individual access with societal costs; however, such radical strategies may require substantial public support to be politically viable."
    },
    {
      "header": "Enhancing international activity",
      "content": "The global nature of antimicrobial resistance requires international collaboration, emphasizing the need for new drugs, diagnostics, and research into resistance mechanisms and control strategies, with the UK developing an integrated strategy that also advocates at EU and international levels, though considering potential challenges and impacts of global dynamics on anticipated outcomes."
    },
    {
      "header": "Lessons from climate change",
      "content": "The inertia towards major, radical change for both antimicrobial resistance and climate change stems from a focus on current burdens and mismatched personal incentives compared to societal needs, with climate change benefiting from clearer scientific consensus and public support compared to antimicrobial resistance, which lacks similar attention despite its potentially catastrophic outcomes."
    },
    {
      "header": "BOX 2: CASE STUDY HIPS",
      "content": "The analysis explored the potential impact of removing antimicrobial therapies by using data on amputation rates as a proxy, highlighting a significant increase in post-operative infections and mortality rates for procedures like hip replacements if antibiotics were no longer available, illustrating the complex estimation needed to understand the full economic burden of antimicrobial resistance."
    },
    {
      "header": "Search Process",
      "content": "Stage 1 involved searching electronic databases such as Web of Science and Medline using key terms related to antimicrobial resistance and costs, focusing on titles due to resource constraints."
    },
    {
      "header": "Stage 2/4: Citation searching",
      "content": "Reference lists of selected papers were scanned to identify additional relevant studies, and review papers identified during the review process were also used for citation searching, both during and after Stage 3 of searching."
    },
    {
      "header": "Stage 3: Further electronic bibliographic database searching relating to specific terminology",
      "content": "The citation lists of both empirical papers identified in the initial search and key review papers indicated that specific evidence related to the costs of resistance against particular microorganisms, such as MRSA and VRE, were overlooked due to the omission of relevant terminology, necessitating a focused secondary search."
    },
    {
      "header": "Inclusion criteria",
      "content": "The review included papers that provided empirical evidence on the economic impact of antimicrobial resistance, contained information on length of stay, mortality, patient cost, and/or societal cost, had a control group with susceptible infection, were published since 2000 in English-language peer-reviewed journals, and focused on the costs of resistance rather than infection, while excluding review papers but using them for citation tracking."
    },
    {
      "header": "Identification of papers",
      "content": "Papers from the stage 1 search were screened based on abstracts by three individuals, including an expert in the subject area (JC), with final decisions made after reading the full texts; additional papers were identified through citation searches and subsequent database searches."
    },
    {
      "header": "Data extraction",
      "content": "Standardized data extraction forms, following the earlier systematic review, were used to extract the following data for each study:"
    },
    {
      "header": "Findings",
      "content": "The review identified 24 relevant papers, with findings summarized in the report, and details from individual studies included in Table 1; however, due to resource constraints, the comprehensive scope of the literature on antimicrobial resistance is likely underestimated, though studies on MRSA and VRE provide insights into the overall burden of resistance."
