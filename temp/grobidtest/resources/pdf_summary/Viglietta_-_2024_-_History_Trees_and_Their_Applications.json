{"name": "Viglietta_-_2024_-_History_Trees_and_Their_Applications", "abstract_seg": "In the theoretical study of distributed communication networks, history trees are a discrete structure that naturally models the concept that anonymous agents become distinguishable upon receiving different sets of messages from neighboring agents. By conveniently organizing temporal information in a systematic manner, history trees have been instrumental in the development of optimal deterministic algorithms for networks that are both anonymous and dynamically evolving. This note provides an accessible introduction to history trees, drawing comparisons with more traditional structures found in existing literature and reviewing the latest advancements in the applications of history trees, especially within dynamic networks. Furthermore, it expands the theoretical framework of history trees in new directions, also highlighting several open problems for further investigation.", "segments": [{"header": "Introduction", "content": "The introduction of history trees has recently led to the development of optimal linear-time algorithms for anonymous dynamic networks In Section 2, we outline the basic architecture of history trees, drawing comparisons with Yamashita-Kameda's views and Boldi-Vigna's minimum bases."}, {"header": "Basic Structure and Algorithms", "content": "The two views are matched and merged starting from the roots, v gets a child v \u2032 , and a new red edge from u to v \u2032 is added.and u \u2208 L t , indicates that, at step t, each agent represented by node u receives exactly m (identical) messages from agents represented by v.Assuming that their internal memory and message sizes are unbounded, the agents in a network G can locally construct portions of the history tree called views."}, {"header": "Leader Election", "content": ""}]}
