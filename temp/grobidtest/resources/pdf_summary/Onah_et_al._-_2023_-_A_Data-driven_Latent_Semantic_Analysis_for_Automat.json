{"name": "Onah_et_al._-_2023_-_A_Data-driven_Latent_Semantic_Analysis_for_Automat", "abstract_seg": "With the advent and popularity of big data mining and huge text analysis in modern 8mes, automated text summariza8on became prominent for extrac8ng and retrieving important informa8on from documents. This research inves8gates aspects of automa8c text summariza8on from the perspec8ves of single and mul8ple documents. Summariza8on is a task of condensing huge text ar8cles into short, summarized versions. The text is reduced in size for summariza8on purpose but preserving key vital informa8on and retaining the meaning of the original document. This study presents the Latent Dirichlet Alloca8on (LDA) approach used to perform topic modelling from summarised medical science journal ar8cles with topics related to genes and diseases. In this study, PyLDAvis webbased interac8ve visualiza8on tool was used to visualise the selected topics. The visualisa8on provides an overarching view of the main topics while allowing and aHribu8ng deep meaning to the prevalence individual topic. This study presents a novel approach to summariza8on of single and mul8ple documents. The results suggest the terms ranked purely by considering their probability of the topic prevalence within the processed document using extrac8ve summariza8on technique. PyLDAvis visualiza8on describes the flexibility of exploring the terms of the topics' associa8on to the fiHed LDA model. The topic modelling result shows prevalence within topics 1 and 2. This associa8on reveals that there is similarity between the terms in topic 1 and 2 in this study. The efficacy of the LDA and the extrac8ve summariza8on methods were measured using Latent Seman8c Analysis (LSA) and Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gis8ng Evalua8on (ROUGE) metrics to evaluate the reliability and validity of the model.", "segments": [{"header": "I.
