{"name": "Deienno_et_al._-_2024_-_Accretion_and_Uneven_Depletion_of_the_Main_Asteroi", "abstract_seg": "The main asteroid belt (MAB) is known to be primarily composed of objects from two distinct taxonomic classes, generically defined here as S-and C-complex. The former probably originated from the inner solar system (interior to Jupiter's orbit), while the latter probably from the outer solar system. Following this definition, (4) Vesta, a V-type residing in the inner MAB (a < 2.5 au), is the sole D > 500 km object akin to S-complex that potentially formed in-situ. This provides a useful constraint on the number of D > 500 km bodies that could have formed, or grown, within the primordial MAB. In this work we numerically simulate the accretion of objects in the MAB region during the time when gas in the protoplanetary disk still existed, while assuming different MAB primordial masses. We then accounted for the depletion of that population happening after gas disk dispersal. In our analysis, we subdivided the MAB into five sub-regions and showed that the depletion factor varies throughout the MAB. This results in uneven radial-and size-dependent depletion of the MAB. We show that the MAB primordial mass has to be \u2272 2.14\u00d710 -3 Earth masses. Larger primordial masses would lead to the accretion of tens-to-thousands of S-complex objects with D > 500 km in the MAB. Such large objects would survive depletion even in the outer sub-regions (a > 2.5 au), thus being inconsistent with observations. Our results also indicate that S-complex objects with D > 200-300 km, including (4) Vesta, are likely to be terrestrial planetesimals implanted into the MAB rather than formed in-situ.", "segments": [{"header": "INTRODUCTION", "content": "The few works that accounted for collisional evolution of the MAB (e.g.; To do that, it is important that we consider not only the MAB total mass, but also its SFD.Only three objects in the current MAB have D > 500 km."}, {"header": "MODEL", "content": ""}, {"header": "MAB, DATASET, AND COMPARISON WITH MPC", "content": "Labels all and AM D JS P S /P J are for different cuts in the data by \u2022 C19 all refers to results taken from \u2022 C19 AM DJS P S /P J is also for results from The work by Our analyses clearly demonstrate that MAB depletion during the giant planet instability is not uniform."}, {"header": "RESULTS", "content": ""}, {"header": "CONCLUSIONS", "content": "This is important as it is well known that the giant planet instability The first main result of the present work is that we found the MAB depletion is uneven, i.e., different radial subregions of the MAB are depleted at different rates (Table The second main result of the present work is that we found the maximum total mass that could have formed in the primordial MAB at around 0.5 Myr after CAIs is likely to be smaller than \u2248 2.14\u00d710 -3 M \u2295 ."}]}
