{"name": "Elokda_et_al._-_2024_-_Karma_An_Experimental_Study", "abstract_seg": "A system of non-tradable credits that flow between individuals like karma, hence proposed under that name, is a mechanism for repeated resource allocation that comes with attractive efficiency and fairness properties, in theory. In this study, we test karma in an online experiment in which human subjects repeatedly compete for a resource with time-varying and stochastic individual preferences or urgency to acquire the resource. We confirm that karma has significant and sustained welfare benefits even in a population with no prior training. We identify mechanism usage in contexts with sporadic high urgency, more so than with frequent moderate urgency, and implemented as an easy (binary) karma bidding scheme as particularly effective for welfare improvements: relatively larger aggregate efficiency gains are realized that are (almost) Pareto superior. These findings provide guidance for further testing and for future implementation plans of such mechanisms in the real world.", "segments": [{"header": "INTRODUCTION", "content": "Indeed, To date, the literature on karma focused on the theoretical properties of the mechanism compared with random allocation and other domain-specific schemes such as dynamic pricing or max-min allocation Our main findings summarize as follows."}, {"header": "EXPERIMENTAL METHODS", "content": "After the redistribution the game proceeds to the next round \ud835\udc61 + 1.Table We follow a 2x2 factorial treatment design, where we vary the dynamic urgency process of the participants and the richness of the karma scheme."}, {"header": "RESULTS", "content": "Then the efficiency gain is defined asand gives the relative improvement of participant \ud835\udc56 with respect to the ex-ante expected random allocation.\nFigure The findings of Figure Figure Notice that the variability in the ex-post efficiency gains under random allocation, cf."}, {"header": "DISCUSSION", "content": "To investigate this, we compared the aggregate efficiency gains realized in our online experiments to those that would be achieved in theory in a short-sighted equilibrium, as predicted by Another important consideration regarding implementation of karma with human participants is whether a simpler scheme (binary) or a richer scheme (full range) is favourable."}]}
