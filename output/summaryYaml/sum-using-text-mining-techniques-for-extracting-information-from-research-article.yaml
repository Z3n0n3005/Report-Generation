abstractSeg: 'In our study, we collected, and textually analyzed through various text
  mining techniques, three hundred refereed journal articles in the field of mobile
  learning from six scientific databases, namely: Springer, Wiley, Science Direct,
  SAGE, IEEE, and Cambridge.

  Experimental results indicated that Springer database represents the main source
  for research articles in the field of mobile education for the medical domain.'

- content: For example, in E-commerce, a major issue with web mining is buying all
    the materials which are not relevant to the user's search and it will not show
    unknown (hidden or implicit) information, while the major objective of text mining
    is to find out the unknown information [6]; something that is not recognized by
    anyone.Data is the basic kind of information, which is required to be organized
    and mined for the knowledge generation.
  header: Introduction
- content: In order to discover nonfigurative patterns in the extracted data, data
    mining algorithms and techniques can be used.Song and Kim [40] presented the first
    attempt to apply text mining approaches to a huge collection of full-text articles
    for discovering the knowledge structure of the area.

- content: 'The minimum number of the characters that the token should have is 4,
    while the maximum number is 25 characters.The application of various text mining
    techniques on the collected articles presents different results and suggestions.

    In the present study, we are trying to apply almost all of the text mining techniques
    that were mentioned in the literature on the collected articles.'
  header: Experimental Results
- content: Results revealed that the similarity operator could not detect a clear
    similarity among some topics the reason is that these topics are interrelated
    and similar in meaning to each other (i.e. all the articles are discussing the
    topic of mobile learning in higher education).By applying the clustering technique,
    we used the k-means algorithm through the use of different k values.
