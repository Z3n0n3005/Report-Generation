abstractSeg: 'It effectively works by treating complex suffixes as compounds made
  up of simple suffixes, and removing the simple suffixes in a number of steps.

  In each step the removal of the suffix is made to depend upon the form of the remaining
  stem, which usually involves a measure of its syllable length.'

- content: Assuming that one is not making use of a stem dictionary, and that the
    purpose of the task is to improve IR performance, the suffix stripping program
    will usually be given an explicit list of suffixes, and, with each suffix, the
    criterion under which it may be removed from a word to leave a valid stem.

- content: "The rules for removing a suffix will be given in the form (condition)\
    \ S1 \u2192 S2 This means that if a word ends with the suffix S1, and the stem\
    \ before S1 satisfies the given condition, S1 is replaced by S2."
