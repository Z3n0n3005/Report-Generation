abstractSeg: "It effectively works by treating complex suffixes as compounds made\
  \ up of simple suffixes, and removing the simple suffixes in a number of steps."

- header: "INTRODUCTION"
  content: "This may be done by removal of the various suffixes -ED, -ING, -ION, -IONS\
    \ to leave the single stem CONNECT In addition, the suffix stripping process will\
    \ reduce the total number of terms in the IR system, and hence reduce the size\
    \ and complexity of the data in the system, which is always advantageous. [1][2][3][4][5][6]\
    \ The nature of the task will vary considerably depending on whether a stem dictionary\
    \ is being used, whether a suffix list is being used, and of course on the purpose\
    \ for which the suffix stripping is being done."
- header: "THE ALGORITHM"
  content: "A list ccc ... of length greater than 0 will be denoted by C, and a list\
    \ vvv ... of length greater than 0 will be denoted by V Any word, or part of a\
    \ word, therefore has one of the four forms: CVCV ... C CVCV ... V VCVC ... C\
    \ VCVC ... V These may all be represented by the single form [C] VCVC ... [V]\
    \ where the square brackets denote arbitrary presence of their contents. And the\
    \ condition part may also contain expressions with and, or and not, so that (m>\
    \ 1 and (*S or *T))tests for a stem with m> 1 ending in S or T, while (*d and\
    \ not (*L or *S or *Z)) tests for a stem ending with a double consonant other\
    \ than L, S or Z Elaborate conditions like this are required only very rarely.In\
    \ a set of rules written beneath each other, only one is obeyed, and this will\
    \ be the one with the longest matching S1 for the given word."
