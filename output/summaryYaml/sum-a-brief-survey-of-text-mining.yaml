abstractSeg: "The enormous amount of information stored in unstructured texts cannot\
  \ simply be used for further processing by computers, which typically handle text\
  \ as simple sequences of character strings. Text mining refers generally to the\
  \ process of extracting interesting information and knowledge from unstructured\
  \ text."

- header: "Introduction"
  content: "Text mining aims at disclosing the concealed information by means of methods\
    \ which on the one hand are able to cope with the large number of words and structures\
    \ in natural language and on the other hand allow to handle vagueness, uncertainty\
    \ and fuzziness.In this paper we describe text mining as a truly interdisciplinary\
    \ method drawing on information retrieval, machine learning, statistics, computational\
    \ linguistics and especially data mining."
- header: "Text Encoding"
  content: "Even though, meanwhile several methods exist that try to exploit also\
    \ the syntactic structure and semantics of text, most text mining approaches are\
    \ based on the idea that a text document can be represented by a set of words,\
    \ i.e. a text document is described based on the set of words contained in it\
    \ (bag-of-words representation). Furthermore, we describe the vector space model\
    \ and corresponding similarity measures in more detail, since this model will\
    \ be used by several text mining approaches discussed in this article. For mining\
    \ large document collections it is necessary to pre-process the text documents\
    \ and store the information in a data structure, which is more appropriate for\
    \ further processing than a plain text file."
- header: "Data Mining Methods for Text"
  content: "If a set of examples is available machine learning methods as described\
    \ in section 3, especially in section 3.3, may be employed to learn the desired\
    \ tags.It turned out, however, that for many text mining tasks linguistic preprocessing\
    \ is of limited value compared to the simple bag-of-words approach with basic\
    \ preprocessing. 2003;Bloehdorn & Hotho 2004).One main reason for applying data\
    \ mining methods to text document collections is to structure them."
- header: "Applications"
  content: "Frequently used is the hidden Markov model (HMM), which is based on the\
    \ conditional distributions of current labels L (j) given the previous label L\
    \ (j-1) and the distribution of the current word t (j) given the current and the\
    \ previous labels L (j) , L (j-1) . Note that we do not model the distribution\
    \ p(t) of the observed words, which may exhibit arbitrary dependencies.We consider\
    \ the simple case that the words t = (t 1 , t 2 , . . . , t n ) and the corresponding\
    \ labels L 1 , L 2 , . . . , L n have a chain structure and that L c depends only\
    \ on the preceding and succeeding labels L c-1 and L c+1 ."
- header: "Conclusion"
  content: "Good results are also reported in (Krier & Zacca 2002) for an internal\
    \ EPO text classification application with a precision of 81 % and an recall of\
    \ 78 %.Text clustering techniques for patent analysis are often applied to support\
    \ the analysis of patents in large companies by structuring and visualizing the\
    \ investigated corpus. 1999) the IBM Intelligent Miner for text in a scenario\
    \ applied to patent text and compares it also to data mining and text mining."
