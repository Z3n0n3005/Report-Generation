abstractSeg: 'The enormous amount of information stored in unstructured texts cannot
  simply be used for further processing by computers, which typically handle text
  as simple sequences of character strings.

  Text mining refers generally to the process of extracting interesting information
  and knowledge from unstructured text.'

- content: Text mining aims at disclosing the concealed information by means of methods
    which on the one hand are able to cope with the large number of words and structures
    in natural language and on the other hand allow to handle vagueness, uncertainty
    and fuzziness.In this paper we describe text mining as a truly interdisciplinary
    method drawing on information retrieval, machine learning, statistics, computational
    linguistics and especially data mining.
  header: Introduction
- content: Even though, meanwhile several methods exist that try to exploit also the
    syntactic structure and semantics of text, most text mining approaches are based
    on the idea that a text document can be represented by a set of words, i.e. a
    text document is described based on the set of words contained in it (bag-of-words
    representation).
  header: Text Encoding
- content: 'If a set of examples is available machine learning methods as described
    in section 3, especially in section 3.3, may be employed to learn the desired
    tags.It turned out, however, that for many text mining tasks linguistic preprocessing
    is of limited value compared to the simple bag-of-words approach with basic preprocessing.

    2003;Bloehdorn & Hotho 2004).One main reason for applying data mining methods
    to text document collections is to structure them.'
  header: Data Mining Methods for Text
- content: In the following we give a brief overview of visualization methods that
    have been realized for text mining and information retrieval systems.Interesting
    approaches to visualize keyword-document relations are, e.g., the Cat-a-Cone model
    (Hearst & Karadi 1997), which visualizes in a three dimensional representation
    hierarchies of categories that can be interactively used to refine a search.
  header: Applications
- content: Good results are also reported in (Krier & Zacca 2002) for an internal
    EPO text classification application with a precision of 81 % and an recall of
    78 %.Text clustering techniques for patent analysis are often applied to support
    the analysis of patents in large companies by structuring and visualizing the
    investigated corpus.
