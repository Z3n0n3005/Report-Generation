abstractSeg: The marketing hype says that these systems convert unstructured data
  (text, better called data with complex structure) into structured data, entity-relationship
  statements often represented in tables and graphs, structures that are simpler and
  easier to search than text.The compilation includes old documents from Inxight because
  they give better examples and a much better explanation of the process.

- content: 'The template builder has to predict what information will be of interest
    to the customer according to his field of activity.In an industrial context, the
    aim of Information Extraction is to build an extraction model adapted to the customer''s
    application (its information assets: databases, documents and all the data issued
    by or received in a company).'
  header: Overview
- content: ''
  header: Methodology
- content: 'The extraction server proceeds in two stages: 1.

    the morpho-syntactic analysis -each entry is assigned a part of speech and a morphologic
    feature 2.

    the application of extraction rules.'
  header: Processing
- content: 'The extraction component, which performs semantic labeling from morpho-syntactically
    tagged texts, has been implemented using a dynamic composition of transducers.

    According to the specific processing, three levels of transducer components have
    been distinguished.'
  header: Transducers Technology
- content: The name recognition component on the other hand will treat these names
    as tokens, exploiting the fact that in most domains, most names tend to be mentioned
    with a limited set of topics and thus often serve as good features for a classification
    component.DocCat currently runs in a specific setting where documents that are
    assigned to one or several broad topics (TOP = {sports, theatre, economics, ...})
    have to be annotated with finer labels from a fixed vocabulary of thesaurus terms
    (SUBTOP = {..., aids, demonstration, university, theft, cancer, ...
  header: Results
- content: The resulting classifier then is able to process a document in less than
    a second and annotate it in the way described above.DocCat runs as a separate
    process that is called over a simple interface (file or TCP/IP) from the respective
    text documentation environment and delivers its results back over the same interface.
  header: System specifications
- content: 'The DocCat automatic indexing system can be applied in a real world setting,
    yielding results that enhance the efficiency of manual indexing.

    For the setting up of a classifier for a new domain or a new classification system,
    nothing but the annotated training corpus is neededno hand coding of grammar or
    correlation rules is required.'
  header: Conclusion and Outlook
- content: "DocCat is a project that uses Insight Discoverer\u2122 technologies (ID\
    \ Extractor and ID Categorizer), which is a system for the automatic categorization,\
    \ indexing, and archival of textual data for large commercial text archives."
  header: Introduction
- content: 'The term automatic indexing here refers to the process of assigning terms
    to a document that correspond to its content, and not to the process of setting
    up an index for full text retrieval.

    DocCat assigns index terms (here, "topics") to each document.'
  header: Description
- content: When the results of this pilot study turned out to be encouraging, a continued
    cooperation was agreed upon where DocCat was to be extended towards a system that
    could be applied to everyday tasks in a commercial text archive.The idea in both
    the pilot study and the second phase was that the G&J archive should form a training
    corpus of manually annotated documents that would enable specific machine learning
    algorithms to collect correlations between a document's textual data and the presence
    or absence of a specific label.
  header: The making of DocCat
- content: 'A fundamental requirement in setting up the DocCat system was that the
    amount of effort that had to be invested in building corpus-or domain-specific
    knowledge bases such as dictionaries, grammars or thesauri should be kept as low
    as possible.

    If no new types of labels need to be considered, building a new classifier will
    require only a training corpus of annotated documents as input.'
