abstractSeg: "Results show that extractive and abstractive-oriented summaries perform\
  \ similarly as far as the information they contain, so both approaches are able\
  \ to keep the relevant information of the source documents, but the latter is more\
  \ appropriate from a human perspective, when a user satisfaction assessment is carried\
  \ out. Two approaches are suggested: an extractive (COMPENDIUME), which only selects\
  \ and extracts the most relevant sentences of the documents, and an abstractive-oriented\
  \ one (COMPENDIUME-A), thus facing also the challenge of abstractive summarization."

- header: "Introduction"
  content: "The main problem associated to extractive summarization is the lack of\
    \ coherence resulting summaries exhibit, partly due to non-resolved coreference\
    \ relationships, and the wrong link between sentences.Therefore, in this article,\
    \ our goal is to analyze to what extent TS is useful for a specific application:\
    \ the automatic generation of research paper abstracts in the biomedical domain.\
    \ Therefore, the specific objectives within the scope of this article we want\
    \ to analyze are: i) if COMPENDIUM produces good summaries in this domain; ii)\
    \ which is the best strategy to adopt for generating this type of summaries (extractive\
    \ or abstractive-oriented); and iii) the opinion of real users towards automatic\
    \ summaries.The structure of the article is as follows: Section 2 introduces previous\
    \ work on state-of-the-art TS systems, as well as TS approaches that were developed\
    \ for addressing specific applications."
- header: "Related work"
  content: "In this section, we explain existing TS systems that produce summaries\
    \ automatically, as well as previous work on different approaches that have used\
    \ TS techniques to address specific tasks (e.g. for generating Wikipedia articles\
    \ [37], weather forecast reports [3], etc.).Regarding the TS systems, we can find\
    \ a wide range of them for generating different types of summaries. In particular,\
    \ this system has been proven to work successfully in the newswire, biomedical,\
    \ and tourist domain, and the techniques used have been also successfully employed\
    \ for retrieving information from medical records [28].Furthermore, we can also\
    \ find systems that are especially targeted to produce a specific type of summaries\
    \ (e.g., sentiment-based summaries) or deal with multi-linguality."
- header: "Text summarization approach: COMPENDIUM"
  content: "In this Section, the two suggested approaches that COMPENDIUM TS system\
    \ is able to follow for generating summaries are explained. First we described\
    \ COMPENDIUM E , a pure extractive TS approach (Section 3.1), and then we take\
    \ this extractive approach as a basis in an attempt to improve the final summaries\
    \ by integrating abstractive techniques, leading to COMPENDIUM E-A (Section 3.2)."
- header: "Experimental framework"
  content: "Therefore, by applying TE we can obtain a set of sentences from the text\
    \ which do not hold an entailment relation with any other, and then keep this\
    \ set of sentences for further processing. â€¢ Summary generation: finally, having\
    \ computed the score for each sentence, in this last stage of the TS process sentences\
    \ are ranked according to their relevance and the highest ones are selected and\
    \ extracted in the same order as they appear in the original document, thus generating\
    \ an extractive summary, and leading to COMPENDIUME variant.Fig."
- header: "Evaluation and discussion"
  content: "In addition, each article may contain figures and tables, which are not\
    \ taken into consideration for generating the summaries.A fragment of an article\
    \ together with its complete abstract is shown in Tables 1 and2, respectively.\
    \ The abstracts included in the articles were generated by the authors, and therefore,\
    \ we use them as gold-standard for comparing them with respect to the results\
    \ obtained by our TS system COMPENDIUM  For using the abstracts as gold-standards,\
    \ we carry out an analysis of different properties concerning the number of words\
    \ and sentences the text of the article and the abstract have, as well as its\
    \ compression ratio."
- header: "Conclusion and future work"
  content: "On the other hand, the qualitative evaluation was conducted by means of\
    \ a user satisfaction study where real users rated the generated summaries according\
    \ to three criteria: their topics, content, and suitability for substituting the\
    \ original abstracts in the research articles.Although the results concerning\
    \ the quantitative evaluation benefited the extractive summaries, showing that\
    \ the summaries generated with COMPENDIUM E-A contained less similar information\
    \ to the human-written abstracts included in the articles than the summaries produced\
    \ with the extractive approach (COMPENDIUM E ), we can conclude that according\
    \ to the satisfaction users have towards both kind of summaries, the abstractive-oriented\
    \ summaries COMPENDIUM E-A are the most appropriate."
