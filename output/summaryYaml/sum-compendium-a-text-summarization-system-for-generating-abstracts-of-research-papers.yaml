abstractSeg: Results show that extractive and abstractive-oriented summaries perform
  similarly as far as the information they contain, so both approaches are able to
  keep the relevant information of the source documents, but the latter is more appropriate
  from a human perspective, when a user satisfaction assessment is carried out.

- content: 'Therefore, the specific objectives within the scope of this article we
    want to analyze are: i) if COMPENDIUM produces good summaries in this domain;
    ii) which is the best strategy to adopt for generating this type of summaries
    (extractive or abstractive-oriented); and iii) the opinion of real users towards
    automatic summaries.The structure of the article is as follows: Section 2 introduces
    previous work on state-of-the-art TS systems, as well as TS approaches that were
    developed for addressing specific applications.'
  header: Introduction
- content: That is the case of CBSEAS [4] which generate multi-document extractive
    sentiment-based summaries, or MUSE -MUltilingual Sentence Extractor [21], that
    employs language-independent techniques for generating summaries in English and
    Hebrew.In other contexts, TS techniques and approaches have been used for solving
    specific tasks.

- content: 'In this Section, the two suggested approaches that COMPENDIUM TS system
    is able to follow for generating summaries are explained.

    First we described COMPENDIUM E , a pure extractive TS approach (Section 3.1),
    and then we take this extractive approach as a basis in an attempt to improve
    the final summaries by integrating abstractive techniques, leading to COMPENDIUM
    E-A (Section 3.2).'
  header: 'Text summarization approach: COMPENDIUM'
- content: 'In this approach, extractive and abstractive techniques are combined in
    the following manner: we take as a basis the COMPENDIUM E approach described in
    the previous subsection (Section 3.1), and we integrate an information compression
    and fusion stage after the relevant sentences have been identified and before
    the final summary is generated, thus generating abstractive-oriented summaries.'
