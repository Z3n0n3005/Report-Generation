abstractSeg: Originality/value -This is a first comprehensive systematic review on
  knowledge discovery and text mining through the use of a text mining technique at
  term level, which offers to reduce redundant research and to avoid the possibility
  of missing relevant publications.
sectionList:
- content: The systematic review is conducted by applying "text mining at the term
    level, in which knowledge discovery takes place on a more focused collection of
    words and phrases that are extracted from and label each document" (Feldman et
    al., 1998, p.
  header: Introduction
- content: ''
  header: Literature review
- content: Basically, the authors adopt a j JOURNAL OF KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT j multi-layered
    method to searching which is based on a wide Boolean searches of online reference
    databases, key information and "citation trails".Additionally, the systematic
    review is also conducted by applying "text mining at the term level, in which
    knowledge discovery takes place on a more focused collection of words and phrases
    that are extracted from and label each document" (Feldman et al., 1998, p.
  header: Methodology
- content: 'Whereas, a varied range of fields emerged from 2010 to 2017, owing to
    a greater interest in the online environment, and therefore, terms like microblogging,
    text mining in social media, knowledgeable users and review manipulation are more
    used.In 2010 four papers were considered relevant, and the following terms were
    extracted: emotional polarity of text, text mining approach, text data, extracting
    information, extracting knowledge and sentiment knowledge discovery.'
  header: Results
- content: The concept of a multivariate source induces studies on text-mining networks
    (Yoon and Park, 2004) and free open source for data extracting from machine learning
    (Mierswa et al., 2006).In short, in the first period (1998)(1999)(2000)(2001)(2002)(2003)(2004)(2005)(2006)(2007)(2008)(2009),
    the studies on knowledge discovery by applying text mining were approached in
    a more technical way.
