abstractSeg: 'Now the research has shifted towards the abstractive summarization.

  The complexities underlying with the natural language text makes abstractive summarization
  a difficult and a challenging task.This paper presents a comprehensive review of
  the various works performed in abstractive summarization field.

  We have also listed down the various tools which have been used or developed by
  researchers for abstractive summarization.'

- content: 'According to how the content is selected and organized in the summary,
    the summarization techniques are categorized into extractive and abstractive techniques.

    Extractive summarization is to find out the most salient sentences from the text
    by considering the statistical features and then arranging the extracted sentences
    to create the summary.'
  header: Introduction
- content: 'Abstractive Summarization (Moratanch & Chitrakala, 2016) (Khan, 2014)
    (Dineshnath.G & S.Saraswathi, 2018) have classified the abstractive summarization
    approaches broadly into the structure-based and semantic-based.

    Structure-based approaches are those where the important information of the text
    is populated into the pre-defined structure to create the abstractive summaries.'
  header: Existing Approaches to
- content: (Nema et al., 2018) have attempted to solve the problem of repeated phrase
    generation by sequence-to-sequence model by using diversity-driven attention model,
    which helped achieve a gain of 28% in ROUGE-L Score.Even though deep learning
    has been applied successfully and emerged as one of the promising approaches to
    create the abstractive summaries.

- content: "It involves morphological and syntactic transformations.\u2022 Evaluation:\
    \ Here the paragraphs are ranked and sorted according to various factors like\
    \ coherence between the sentences, most frequently used word synonyms, etc.To\
    \ summarize the works done in this field of research, we have listed them in the\
    \ tabular form in Table 5 in page 24 which lists down the author name, Evaluation\
    \ measure used, dataset used, and type of abstractive summary created.From our\
    \ survey, we have found that most of the abstractive summarization systems consist\
    \ of 3 steps namely pre-processing, inferencing and Natural Language Generation."
  header: Tools Used and Developed

    \ generator to create the final abstract summaries.\u2022 COMPENDIUM (Lloret et\
    \ al., 2013) uses both the extractive and abstractive techniques to create the\
    \ final summary."

    \ FUF or SURGE Language Generator31 : It is used to generate the sentences by\

  header: Natural Language Generation Tools

    \ matching approach called ERSOM, which finds the semantically related entities\
    \ between different ontologies.\u2022 Need of Cross-Language Based Abstractive\
    \ Summarization Systems: Cross-language summarization is to produce the summary\
    \ of a text written in some source language like Sanskrit in some other target\

  header: Challenges and Future Direction
- content: 'Abstractive summarization is an interesting topic of research among the
    NLP community and helps produce coherent, concise, non-redundant and information
    rich summaries.

    Along with these we have also mentioned the tools which have been used in various
    researches related to abstractive summarization.'
