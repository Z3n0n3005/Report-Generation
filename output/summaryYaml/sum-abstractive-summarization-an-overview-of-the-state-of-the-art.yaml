abstractSeg: "Summarization techniques, on the basis of whether the exact sentences\
  \ are considered as they appear in the original text or new sentences are generated\
  \ using natural language processing techniques, are categorized into extractive\
  \ and abstractive techniques. The complexities underlying with the natural language\
  \ text makes abstractive summarization a difficult and a challenging task.This paper\
  \ presents a comprehensive review of the various works performed in abstractive\
  \ summarization field."

- header: "Introduction"
  content: "The exponential growth of information due to the popularity of web environment\
    \ has lead to the need of automatic summarization in order to reduce the effort\
    \ and time while finding the concise and relevant information according to the\
    \ query. Extractive summarization is to find out the most salient sentences from\
    \ the text by considering the statistical features and then arranging the extracted\
    \ sentences to create the summary."
- header: "Existing Approaches to"
  content: "Whereas Semantic-based approaches are those which take the text document\
    \ as input, create the semantic representation of text and then feed this representation\
    \ to Natural Language Generation system to create the final abstractive summary."
- header: "Generating the Abstractive Summaries"
  content: "They used the bidirectional encoder with GRU(Gatted Recurrent Unit, used\
    \ to solve the vanishing and exploding gradient problems)-RNN and unidirectional\
    \ decoder with GRU-RNN They used the attention model on the hidden-states of source\
    \ and softmax layer on the target. They created the summary according to the user\
    \ preferences like entity, whose information they want to know, the size of summary,\
    \ part of text whose summary they want to obtain.Most of the deep learning based\
    \ models are applied to the single-document generic systems."
- header: "Tools Used and Developed"
  content: "It involves morphological and syntactic transformations.â€¢ Evaluation:\
    \ Here the paragraphs are ranked and sorted according to various factors like\
    \ coherence between the sentences, most frequently used word synonyms, etc.To\
    \ summarize the works done in this field of research, we have listed them in the\
    \ tabular form in Table 5 in page 24 which lists down the author name, Evaluation\
    \ measure used, dataset used, and type of abstractive summary created.From our\
    \ survey, we have found that most of the abstractive summarization systems consist\
    \ of 3 steps namely pre-processing, inferencing and Natural Language Generation."
- header: "Summarization Tools"
  content: "The system first identifies the relevant sentences on the basis of surface\
    \ linguistic analysis, redundancy detection by using Textual entailment tool,\
    \ topic identification by using TF-IDF and relevance detection by code quantity\
    \ principle; then the information compression and fusion is performed to generate\
    \ the abstractive summaries."
- header: "Natural Language Generation Tools"
  content: "FUF or SURGE Language Generator31 : It is used to generate the sentences\
    \ by fusing and merging the phrases. FUF is a natural language generation tool\
    \ which is based on unification of grammars."
- header: "Challenges and Future Direction"
  content: "Few of the challenges in this field are listed down as below:On the basis\
    \ of whether the evaluation is performed by comparing the results obtained by\
    \ using some automatic method executed by the system or by comparing the results\
    \ obtained by people assessment, the evaluation techniques are divided into: quantitative\
    \ and qualitative. And, On the basis of whether the quality of summary is assessed\
    \ by itself or the impact of summary on other tasks like readability is calculated\
    \ to determine its effectiveness, are divided into intrinsic and extrinsic evaluation.In\
    \ quantitative evaluation, the informativeness of sentence is analyzed on the\
    \ basis of content available."
- header: "Conclusion"
  content: "Abstractive summarization is an interesting topic of research among the\
    \ NLP community and helps produce coherent, concise, non-redundant and information\
    \ rich summaries. Along with these we have also mentioned the tools which have\
    \ been used in various researches related to abstractive summarization."
