abstractSeg: 'ATS approaches are either extractive, abstractive, or hybrid.

  The extractive approach selects the most important sentences in the input document(s)
  then concatenates them to form the summary.

  The abstractive approach represents the input document(s) in an intermediate representation
  then generates the summary with sentences that are different than the original sentences.

  The hybrid approach combines both the extractive and abstractive approaches.'

- content: 'ATS poses many challenges to the research community like: 1) identification
    of the most informative segments in the input text to be included in the generated
    summary (Radev et al., 2002), 2) summarization of long single documents such as
    books, 3) summarization of multi-documents (Hahn & Mani, 2000), 4) evaluation
    of the computer-generated summary without the need for the human-produced summary
    to be compared with, and 5) generation of an abstractive summary (Hahn & Mani,
    2000) similar to a human-produced summary.'

  header: Ats approaches
- content: 'The system consists of two phases: 1) the extraction phase that uses a
    graph model to extract the key sentences, and 2) the abstraction phase that constructs
    an RNN based encoder-decoder and uses a pointer and attention mechanisms to generate
    summaries.Extractive to Shallow Abstractive Methods: These methods start by using
    one of the extractive ATS methods then they use a shallow abstractive text summarization
    method that applies one or more of the following techniques to the extracted sentences:
    information compression techniques, information fusion techniques (Lloret et al.,
    2013), synonym replacement techniques (Patil, Dalmia, Ansari, Aul, & Bhatnagar,
    2014), etc.'
  header: Techniques and building blocks to implement the ATS systems
- content: By analyzing the human-made summaries, they are very likely to include
    the high-frequency words from the original documents (Lloret & Palomar, 2009).There
    are several uses of parsing techniques in the ATS processing phase like constructing
    the text graph models and in the postprocessing phase like sentence compression,
    sentences merging, etc.
  header: Text summarization datasets and evaluation metrics
- content: 'The ATS system performance is usually compared to different baseline systems
    such as using leading sentences from the input document or using common text summarizers
    such as LexRank (Erkan & Radev, 2004), TextRank (Mihalcea & Tarau, 2004), MEAD
    (Radev, Blair-Goldensohn, & Zhang, 2001), etc.The human judges may be asked to
    evaluate the computergenerated summaries using some or all of the following quality
    metrics (Lloret et al., 2017;Mani, 2001):Readability: assess the linguistic quality
    of the summary by checking that it does not contain gaps in its rhetorical structure
    or dangling anaphora.'
