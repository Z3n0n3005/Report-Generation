  content: "Nowadays, almost all of the existing information in different institutions\
    \ (e.g. government, business, industry, and others) is preserved in electronic\
    \ documents in which it contains semi-structured data. In these documents, the\
    \ \"abstract\" is an example of unstructured text component. Whereas, examples\
    \ of structured fields in a document are: author's name, publication date, title,\
    \ and category [1]. A study by [2] stated that text mining has become one of the\
    \ trendy fields that has been incorporated in several research fields such as\
    \ computational linguistics, Information Retrieval (IR) and data mining. Text\
    \ mining is different from data mining [3]. Data mining is focused on discovering\
    \ interesting patterns from large databases rather than textual information [4].\
    \ Information recovery methodologies like text indexing techniques have been developed\
    \ for handling unstructured documents. In conventional researches, it is assumed\
    \ that a user mostly searches for known terms, which have been previously used\
    \ or written by someone else. The main problem is that the search results are\
    \ not relevant to the user's requirements. One solution is to use text mining\
    \ in order to find out relevant information, which is not indicated explicitly\
    \ nor written down so far. The procedure of text mining begins with gathering\
    \ documents through different resources. A particular document would be recovered\
    \ through text mining instrument and by checking its format and character sets;\
    \ it will be pre-processed by this instrument. The document would then pass through\
    \ a text analysis stage. Text analysis includes semantic analysis intended to\
    \ obtain high-quality information through text. Different text analysis methods\
    \ are available. Different methods can be used based on the organization's objective.\
    \ In some cases, text analysis methods are repeated until information is extracted.\
    \ The outcomes can be stored in a management information system that provides\
    \ a large amount of significant information for the user of that system.Text mining\
    \ intends to detect the information that was not recognized before through extracting\
    \ it automatically from various text-based sources. Structured data can be handled\
    \ through data mining tools while unstructured or semi-structured datasets like\
    \ full-text documents, emails, and HTML files can be handled through text mining.\
    \ Typically, the information will be kept in a natural form known as text. Text\
    \ mining is not similar to web mining. When something is explored on the web by\
    \ the user, it means that it is previously known and it was written by someone\
    \ else [5]. For example, in E-commerce, a major issue with web mining is buying\
    \ all the materials which are not relevant to the user's search and it will not\
    \ show unknown (hidden or implicit) information, while the major objective of\
    \ text mining is to find out the unknown information [6]; something that is not\
    \ recognized by anyone.Data is the basic kind of information, which is required\
    \ to be organized and mined for the knowledge generation. Discovering patterns\
    \ and trends from huge data is a significant challenge. Finding out the unknown\
    \ trends and patterns from databases properly is a major objective of data mining.\
    \ It is a method where data pre-processing is necessary before applying any other\
    \ method. Many approaches like clustering, classification, and decision trees\
    \ are involved in data mining. All the textual based information is stored by\
    \ electronic means, either on a client's personal computers or on a web server.\
    \ Due to the increasing growth in hardware storage devices, any computer or laptop\
    \ has the ability to store an enormous amount of data. Creating new information\
    \ can be simple while finding out relevant information from a huge amount of data\
    \ is challenging. In order to extract the relevant information, knowledge, or\
    \ patterns from various sources that are in unstructured form, text mining technique\
    \ can be employed. The common structure of text mining involves two consecutive\
    \ stages: text refining and knowledge distillation. In text refining, free-form\
    \ text documents are converted into an intermediate form, whereas in knowledge\
    \ distillation, patterns or knowledge are derived from intermediate form. Intermediate\
    \ form (IF) can be either semi-structured like the theoretical graph illustration\
    \ or structured like the relational data illustration. IF can be either a document-based\
    \ where every entity symbolizes document, it can be a concept-based where every\
    \ unit symbolizes an object or a concept of interest in a particular area.Various\
    \ research areas, techniques, and models are involved in different research domains.\
    \ The hottest topics of the research domains are the primary focus of many research\
    \ papers. The research results of a particular domain may influence other research\
    \ domains since some research domains may have similar topics. These research\
    \ topics always discuss such a promising research area that is worth studying.\
    \ Therefore, the trend of cross domain is determined in this research. The longitudinal\
    \ trends of academic articles in Mobile Leaning (ML) were explored in this research\
    \ with the help of text mining methods. We recovered and examined (300) refereed\
    \ journal articles and conference proceedings from various authentic databases.The\
    \ primary goals of this research are (1) Using text mining techniques for identifying\
    \ the topics of a scientific text related to ML research and developing a hierarchical\
    \ and evolutionary connection among these topics. (2) Using visualization tools\
    \ for presenting both the topics and the association among them as a convenient\
    \ way to help users to determine relevant topics.This paper is categorized as\
    \ follows: Sect. 2 provides an inclusive background concerning in the text mining\
    \ field. Other related studies are addressed by Sect. 3. Research methodology\
    \ is presented in Sect. 4. The results are demonstrated in Sect. 5. Conclusion\
    \ and future perspectives are presented in Sect. 6."

  content: "Many research works contributed to the field of IE through the use of\
    \ various techniques. The primary focus of these researches was to determine how\
    \ different text mining procedures can be utilized as the structured data sets\
    \ exist in the text document format. This part begins with defining the topic\
    \ of the research, evaluating previous researches, and then major techniques are\
    \ applied using information extraction and text mining. In order to determine\
    \ the topic of each research area and to develop an evolutionary and hierarchical\
    \ connection between these topics, [35] used the method of text mining. Topics\
    \ are presented through visualization tools.Moreover, these tools are used in\
    \ order to show the connection between these topics and to offer interactive functions\
    \ so that users can effectively find the cross-domain topics and know the trends\
    \ of cross-domain research. Moloshnikov et al. [36] developed an algorithm for\
    \ finding documents on a particular topic depending on a selected reference collection\
    \ of documents. In addition, the context-semantic graph for visualization themes\
    \ in search results was also developed. The algorithm depends on the incorporation\
    \ of a group of entropic, probabilistic and semantic developers for mining of\
    \ weighted keywords and set of words that explain the specified topic. Results\
    \ indicated that the average precision is 99% and the recall is 84%. A unique\
    \ technique was also created for making graphs on the basis of the algorithm,\
    \ can remove key phrases with weights. It offers the opportunity to show an arrangement\
    \ of sub-topics in huge sets of documents in compact graph form.In order to offer\
    \ a reference for additional researches of other researchers, [37] discussed the\
    \ research status of text mining technology when it was used in the biomedical\
    \ field that covers 10 years. Biomedical text mining literature incorporated in\
    \ SCI from 2004 to 2013 were recovered, filtered and then examined from the viewpoint\
    \ of research institutions, yearly changes, research areas, local distribution,\
    \ journals sources, and keywords. A prominent increase in the amount of worldwide\
    \ biomedical text mining literature is observed. Among this global literature,\
    \ a huge percentage is taken up by literature related to named entity recognition,\
    \ entity relation extraction, text categorization, text clustering, abbreviations\
    \ extraction, and co-occurrence analysis. Studies carried out in USA and UK are\
    \ considered to be present in the primary position.In order to extract inter-language\
    \ clusters through multilingual documents depending on Closed Concepts Mining\
    \ and vector model, a new statistical approach was suggested by [38]. Formal Concept\
    \ Analysis methods are used for mining Closed Concepts from similar corpora and\
    \ later these Closed Concepts and vector models are utilized in the clustering\
    \ and arrangement of multilingual documents. An experimental assessment is carried\
    \ out over a set of French-English bilingual documents of CLEF's 2003. With a\
    \ notable comparability score and in order to remove the bilingual classes of\
    \ documents, results revealed that the interaction between vector model and Formal\
    \ Concept Analysis is very useful.Santosh [39] suggested the graph mining-based\
    \ document content (i.e. text fields) exploitation. That is, the query generated\
    \ the graph depending on the users' requirements. This is an easy and effective\
    \ graph mining method to extract similar patterns through the documents and changed\
    \ the query graph into model graphs which are utilized when the users are not\
    \ present. An intelligent solution for document information exploitation has been\
    \ created. This is characterized by simplicity, ease of use, accuracy, ease of\
    \ development, and flexibility. In order to understand graph models, it does not\
    \ need a huge collection of document images. Moreover, since model learning consumes\
    \ less than 10 s for an input pattern per class on average, changes, amendments,\
    \ and replacements can be done in the input patterns. Information exploitation\
    \ average performance is shown to have 86.64% as Precision, and 90.80% as a Recall.\
    \ However, the suggested technique failed to offer inclusive and accurate solutions\
    \ for the patterns that have a huge collection of fields in a zigzags arrangement\
    \ due to the query graph intricacy.Sirsat et al. [23] proposed two techniques\
    \ for mining text through online sources. The first technique dealt with the knowledge\
    \ that is required to be shown directly in the documents that need to be mined.\
    \ Text mining and IE are considered as the only effective tools for performing\
    \ that technique. The second one concerned with the documents that hold an actual\
    \ data in unstructured format instead of nonfigurative knowledge. IE can help\
    \ to change the unstructured data presented in the document corpus into structured\
    \ one. In order to discover nonfigurative patterns in the extracted data, data\
    \ mining algorithms and techniques can be used.Song and Kim [40] presented the\
    \ first attempt to apply text mining approaches to a huge collection of full-text\
    \ articles for discovering the knowledge structure of the area. Instead of depending\
    \ on the citation data presented in Web of Science, PubMed Central full-text articles\
    \ have been used for bibliometric examination. Above all, this assisted the creation\
    \ of text mining routines in order to develop a custom-made citation database\
    \ following the full-text mining. Findings showed that most of the documents that\
    \ were published in bioinformatics area were not cited by others. Additionally,\
    \ a constant and linear rise has been observed in the amount of publications across\
    \ publication years. Results revealed that the majority of the retrieved studies\
    \ were inspired by USA-based institutes followed by European institutes. Results\
    \ reported that the major primary focus of the important topics was on biological\
    \ factors. However, according to PageRank, the top 10 articles were highly concerned\
    \ with the computational factors.In order to facilitate the accurate extraction\
    \ of text from PDF files of research articles that can be utilized in text mining\
    \ applications, a \"Layout-Aware PDF Text Extraction\" (LA-PDF Text) system was\
    \ presented by [41]. Text blocks are mined from PDF-formatted fill-text research\
    \ articles under this system and then the system categorizes them into logical\
    \ units depending on rules that typify particular sections. Only the textual content\
    \ of the research articles is focused in the LA-PDF Text system. This system serves\
    \ as a basis for new experiments into more developed extraction methods dealing\
    \ with multi-modal content like images and graphs. The system goes through three\
    \ phases: (1) Identifying contiguous text blocks with the help of spatial layout\
    \ processing in order to discover blocks of contiguous text, (2) Categorization\
    \ of text blocks into metaphorical categories with the help of a rule-based method,\
    \ and (3) Joining categorized text blocks together by arranging them accurately\
    \ which results in the extraction of text from section-wise grouped blocks. An\
    \ evaluation of the accuracy of the block discovery algorithm used in step 2 was\
    \ performed. It was also shown that the system can identify and classify them\
    \ into metaphorical categories with Recall = 0.89%, Precision = 0.96%, and F =\
    \ 0.91%. Moreover, the accuracy of the text mined with the help of LA-PDF Text\
    \ is compared to the text from an Open Access subset of PubMed Central. This accuracy\
    \ is then compared with the text that was mined using the PDF2Text system. These\
    \ are the two frequently used techniques to extract text from PDF.Mooney and Bunescu\
    \ [42] described two techniques for using the natural language information extraction\
    \ for text mining. First, general knowledge can be mined directly from the text.\
    \ A project where a knowledge base of 6580 human protein interactions was extracted\
    \ by mining around 750,000 Medline abstracts in which reconsidered as an example\
    \ of this technique. Second, structured data can be mined through text documents\
    \ or web pages. In order to find out patterns in the mined data, traditional KDD\
    \ methods can be applied. The performed work on the DiscoTEX system and its application\
    \ to Amazon book descriptions, computer science job postings, and resumes were\
    \ considered as an example of this technique. In order to discover units and relations\
    \ in text, research in IE keeps on creating more efficient algorithms. Valuable\
    \ and significant knowledge can be mined effectively from the constantly developing\
    \ body of electronic documents and web pages by using modern approaches in human\
    \ language technology and computational linguistics, and linking them with the\
    \ modern techniques used in machine learning and conventional data mining techniques.\
    \ IE deals with determining a particular set of relevant items through natural\
    \ language documents. In order to discover topics that recur in articles of text\
    \ corpus, another method TopCat (Topic Categories) was proposed by [22]. IE was\
    \ used by this technique in order to discover named entities in individual articles\
    \ and to characterize them as a collection of items of an article. Therefore,\
    \ through recognition of frequent item sets which commonly occurred with named\
    \ entities, the issues in data mining or database context were studied. Association\
    \ rule data mining technique is used by TopCat to discover these frequent item\
    \ sets. By using a hypergraph splitting technique, TopCat further clusters the\
    \ named entities which discovers a collection of frequent item sets with significant\
    \ overlie. In order to discover documents regarding the topic, IR technique was\
    \ used. Different technologies like IE for named entity extraction, association\
    \ rule data mining, clustering of association rules, IR techniques were used in\
    \ this method. TopCat discovers topics that have a logical accuracy with reasonable\
    \ identifiers. Callan and Mitamura [43] presented a new technique for named entity\
    \ detection, called KENE. In order to understand the extraction rules, the knowledge-based\
    \ technique is used in it. Generate-and-test approach is used for named entity\
    \ extraction from structured documents.We can observe from the surveyed literature\
    \ that there is a limitation in addressing the issue of IE from research articles\
    \ using data mining techniques. The synergy between these approaches (i.e. IE\
    \ with data mining techniques) helps to discover different interesting text patterns\
    \ in the retrieved articles. This approach could be applied to a variety of research\
    \ topics, where in each topic can generate a wide range of knowledge patterns.\
    \ Mobile learning (M-learning) has become one of the trendy fields in the higher\
    \ education [44][45][46][47][48][49][50]. In accordance to the existing literature,\
    \ we can perceive that IE and data mining techniques were never applied to the\
    \ M-learning field. This creates a need for collecting several research articles\
    \ in the field of M-learning from different scientific databases and applies the\
    \ synergic approach on them. Additionally, we are trying to respond to the following\
    \ research questions: RQ1: What are the most frequent keywords in the collected\
    \ articles? RQ2: What are the most frequent terms among the collected articles?\
    \ RQ3: What are the most common topics among the collected articles? RQ4: How\
    \ are the articles interrelated to each other? RQ5: How are the articles distributed\
    \ in terms of publication year?"

  content: "We have developed our customized framework which is inspired by the designed\
    \ framework proposed by [51], see Fig. The research articles were collected from\
    \ six scientific databases, namely: Springer, Wiley, Science Direct, SAGE, IEEE,\
    \ and Cambridge. The search term used for data collection is simply \"Mobile Learning\
    \ in higher education\". Based on that, 300 research articles in the field of\
    \ mobile learning were collected. These articles are categorized into six folders,\
    \ where each folder represents the database where these articles were retrieved.The\
    \ presence of the linguistic noise is a common problem in the content of the extracted\
    \ articles and we have dealt with. Then, the cleaned data are uploaded into RapidMiner\
    \ tool while the misplaced and unnecessary data have been removed from the dataset.\
    \ In order to improve the performance and data quality, all the irrelevant characteristics\
    \ are debarred while the data is being uploaded into RapidMiner tool. The major\
    \ steps involve the separation of the document into tokens; this task is called\
    \ Tokenization [52]. The next step is concerned with the transformation process\
    \ of all the characters where each document title is created in a lower case.\
    \ Stop words filtering is involved in the third step, where English is filtered\
    \ through this operator. A single English word is required to be signified by\
    \ each token. All tokens that were similar to stop words were eradicated from\
    \ the provided document by an operator. The document must have only one stop word\
    \ per line. The last step is concerned with the text processing phase that involves\
    \ filtering the tokens according to the length. The minimum number of the characters\
    \ that the token should have is 4, while the maximum number is 25 characters.The\
    \ application of various text mining techniques on the collected articles presents\
    \ different results and suggestions. In the present study, we are trying to apply\
    \ almost all of the text mining techniques that were mentioned in the literature\
    \ on the collected articles. Nevertheless, these techniques have not been applied\
    \ to the research articles concerning mobile learning in higher education; the\
    \ reason that makes this study is unique and adds a value to the research community."

  content: "The present study demonstrates a comprehensive overview about text mining\
    \ and its current research status. According to the surveyed literature, there\
    \ is a limitation in discussing the issue of information extraction from research\
    \ articles using data mining techniques. The synergy between information extraction\
    \ and data mining techniques helps to discover different interesting text patterns\
    \ in the retrieved articles. This approach could be applied to a variety of research\
    \ topics, where in each topic it can generate a wide range of knowledge patterns.\
    \ Mobile learning has become one of the trendy fields in the higher education.\
    \ Accordingly, we can perceive that information extraction and data mining techniques\
    \ were never applied to the mobile learning field. This creates a need for collecting\
    \ a dataset that consists of several research articles in the field of mobile\
    \ learning from different scientific databases, and applying the proposed approach\
    \ on them.Three hundred refereed journal articles from six scientific databases\
    \ were collected, and textually analyzed through text mining techniques. The six\
    \ databases are Science Direct, IEEE, Wiley, Cambridge, SAGE, and Springer. The\
    \ selection of the collected articles was based on the criteria that all these\
    \ articles should incorporate mobile learning as the main component in the higher\
    \ educational context. In the present study, text clustering, association rule,\
    \ word cloud, and word frequency are the main tasks used for text analysis.By\
    \ applying the word cloud and the word frequency techniques, results indicated\
    \ that \"Learning\" is the most frequent keyword across all the collected articles;\
    \ followed by \"Patients\" and \"Students\", respectively. The increasing number\
    \ of the words: \"learning\" and \"students\" could be attributed to the fact\
    \ that learning and students form the core of the higher educational processes.\
    \ In addition, results revealed that the words: \"patients\", \"care\", \"medical\"\
    , and \"clinical\", were frequently mentioned in Springer database. These results\
    \ indicate that the most frequent linked words are those focused on studies targeting\
    \ mobile learning in medical education. Springer database represents the richest\
    \ source that contains these words followed by Wiley and Science Direct, respectively.\
    \ That is, researchers who are specialized in mobile medical education should\
    \ benefit from these results as it shows them that Springer database is the topmost\
    \ among other databases for finding research articles in this field.By applying\
    \ the association rule technique, findings showed that the term \"Education\"\
    \ is shown as being central to the tree structure having all the relevant words\
    \ connected to it. This could be referred to the fact that the text acquired from\
    \ the collected research articles is mainly concentrated on the learning field.\
    \ In addition, we performed the similarity measure on the collected articles in\
    \ order to identify the topics that are highly similar to each other. Results\
    \ revealed that the similarity operator could not detect a clear similarity among\
    \ some topics the reason is that these topics are interrelated and similar in\
    \ meaning to each other (i.e. all the articles are discussing the topic of mobile\
    \ learning in higher education).By applying the clustering technique, we used\
    \ the k-means algorithm through the use of different k values. Results indicated\
    \ that there were six clusters. Almost all of the articles (N = 285) were accumulated\
    \ in one cluster; this indicates that these articles are discussing the main studied\
    \ topic (i.e. mobile learning in higher education). On the other side, by further\
    \ investigating the remaining articles (N = 15) that are accumulated in the other\
    \ clusters; it has been found that these articles are discussing other topics\
    \ in learning and education rather than the studied topic. By distributing the\
    \ collected research papers across their years of publication, findings showed\
    \ that there was a booming increase in the number of published articles during\
    \ the years 2015 through 2016. This could be referred to the reason that mobile\
    \ learning has witnessed in these years an enormous attraction from a lot of scholars\
    \ who published many articles that contribute to the evolvement of mobile learning.As\
    \ a future work, we are interested in collecting articles from various research\
    \ topics, i.e. not to focus on one area. This will help us to find more interesting\
    \ patterns in these articles and how such articles are distributed among the targeted\
    \ databases. In addition, this will allow the similarity operator to work properly\
    \ and to draw a clear relationship among the articles."
