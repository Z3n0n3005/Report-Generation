abstractSeg: "Purpose -The aim of this work is to increase awareness of the potential\
  \ of the technique of text mining to discover knowledge and further promote research\
  \ collaboration between knowledge management and the information technology communities.\
  \ Since its emergence, text mining has involved multidisciplinary studies, focused\
  \ primarily on database technology, Web-based collaborative writing, text analysis,\
  \ machine learning and knowledge discovery."

  content: "In fact, digital organizations are generally notable to fully use their\
    \ employees' knowledge.In this line, to achieve such maximum effective usage and\
    \ so positively influence organizational performance, modern firms seek to acquire\
    \ or create potentially useful knowledge and make it available to those who can\
    \ use it to create value.It is generally believed that if an organization can\
    \ increase its utilization of effective knowledge by expending minimum efforts\
    \ in sharing and creation, they will reap great benefits (King, 2009).Hence, we\
    \ are able to state that in a knowledge-intensive firm, organizational learning\
    \ (OL) as proxy of human being becomes complementary for boosting KM practices\
    \ to turn in routine information, data and text by embedding into the organization\
    \ what has been captured from the environment (Levitt and March, 1988).Because\
    \ the originality of text mining which emphasizes a new source of knowledge discovering\
    \ from \"hard and intangible documents\", we cannot forget that a dyadic relationship\
    \ exists between knowledge and its stakeholders, i.e. people.In literature, knowledge\
    \ has been defined as a \"justified personal belief,\" and it appear as the fundamental\
    \ distinction between tacit and explicit knowledge (Polanyi, 1966).From one side,\
    \ we specify that tacit knowledge inhabits the minds of people, depending on humans'\
    \ interpretation and deriving from their knowledge mind-set, that is difficult\
    \ to interpret."

  content: "(2006) providing the Yale, a free open source for data extracting from\
    \ machine learning, able to fuse and form data from multiple sources.In general,\
    \ there is a need to carefully design models and metrics that are able to analyze\
    \ model correlations between disseminated texts and websites and are able to extract\
    \ the best information from big data (Ristoski and Paulheim, 2016).In this regard,\
    \ literature also discusses the technical challenges related to data samples,\
    \ structures, heterogeneity of sources, mining models and algorithms and systems'\
    \ infrastructures that would support data analytics (Khan et al., 2014;Nahm and\
    \ Mooney, 2002;Larsen and Aone, 1999).Differently, Li and Lai (2014) argue about\
    \ the efficiency of mining in smaller samples of data for online purchase -the\
    \ micro blogosphere -which are in contrast to mining a whole data set, specifically\
    \ large data sets (e.g. They argue that bias mainly depends on the expected number\
    \ of collisions in the sample.Contrarily, a stream of researchers acknowledge\
    \ the lacks of accurate and estimate techniques for consumer reviews in business\
    \ and marketing analysis, thus introducing an accurate bootstrapping-based framework\
    \ that estimates results and errors for the different mining techniques (Galitsky\
    \ et al., 2009;Geva and Zahavi, 2014;Hu et al., 2014).Finally, several authors\
    \ focused on the biomedical sector focusing their research activities on reducing\
    \ bias in specific samples of patients with human disease.The evaluation of their\
    \ proposed algorithms shows that they are moderately effective for the feature\
    \ of knowledge creation from free text applications for studying and practicing\
    \ the diagnosis and treatment of human disease.They are considerably more efficient\
    \ and scalable than some of the existing state-of-the-art batch feature selection\
    \ algorithms (Uramoto et al., 2004;Cohen and Hersh, 2005;Zhou et al., 2010).More\
    \ recently, however, other researchers focused on query optimization techniques\
    \ over big data in semantics, providing repeatable attribution to data scientists\
    \ when algorithms are not efficient in performing text mining on big data."

  content: "Basically, the authors adopt a j JOURNAL OF KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT j multi-layered\
    \ method to searching which is based on a wide Boolean searches of online reference\
    \ databases, key information and \"citation trails\".Additionally, the systematic\
    \ review is also conducted by applying \"text mining at the term level, in which\
    \ knowledge discovery takes place on a more focused collection of words and phrases\
    \ that are extracted from and label each document\" (Feldman et al., 1998, p.\
    \ This is because it requires a person to label each document first and then the\
    \ machine can label future documents (Lent et al., 1997).In this article, the\
    \ authors used the manual labeling approach, associating each document with a\
    \ label derived from \"term extraction method\"."
- header: "Results"
  content: "It has emerged that from 1998 to 2009, the terms knowledge and text were\
    \ always used.From 2010 to 2017 in addition to these terms, sentiment analysis,\
    \ review manipulation, microblogging data and knowledgeable users were the other\
    \ terms frequently used.In particular, in 1998, only one publication was found\
    \ in line with the main labels, i.e. knowledge discovery and text mining. Whereas,\
    \ a varied range of fields emerged from 2010 to 2017, owing to a greater interest\
    \ in the online environment, and therefore, terms like microblogging, text mining\
    \ in social media, knowledgeable users and review manipulation are more used.In\
    \ 2010 four papers were considered relevant, and the following terms were extracted:\
    \ emotional polarity of text, text mining approach, text data, extracting information,\
    \ extracting knowledge and sentiment knowledge discovery."
- header: "Discussion and conclusion"
  content: "To reduce redundant studies and to avoid the possibilities of missing\
    \ relevant publications, this present research offers a systematic literature\
    \ review.More importantly, the interest in data analytics increases exponentially\
    \ from 2010, especially with the increase of the interest in customer behavior,\
    \ leading to greater amount of development in the big data arena competition at\
    \ firm level. Some authors apply sentiment analysis alongside text mining to discover\
    \ knowledge (Schumaker et al., 2012;Yu et al., 2013)."
