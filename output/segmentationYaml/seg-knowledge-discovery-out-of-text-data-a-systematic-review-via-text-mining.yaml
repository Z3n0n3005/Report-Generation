  content: "Before the fourth industrial revolution, in theory and practice, knowledge\
    \ management (KM) has been based on the premise that only human beings are able\
    \ to draw on the full potential of their brain. In fact, digital organizations\
    \ are generally notable to fully use their employees' knowledge.In this line,\
    \ to achieve such maximum effective usage and so positively influence organizational\
    \ performance, modern firms seek to acquire or create potentially useful knowledge\
    \ and make it available to those who can use it to create value.It is generally\
    \ believed that if an organization can increase its utilization of effective knowledge\
    \ by expending minimum efforts in sharing and creation, they will reap great benefits\
    \ (King, 2009).Hence, we are able to state that in a knowledge-intensive firm,\
    \ organizational learning (OL) as proxy of human being becomes complementary for\
    \ boosting KM practices to turn in routine information, data and text by embedding\
    \ into the organization what has been captured from the environment (Levitt and\
    \ March, 1988).Because the originality of text mining which emphasizes a new source\
    \ of knowledge discovering from \"hard and intangible documents\", we cannot forget\
    \ that a dyadic relationship exists between knowledge and its stakeholders, i.e.\
    \ people.In literature, knowledge has been defined as a \"justified personal belief,\"\
    \ and it appear as the fundamental distinction between tacit and explicit knowledge\
    \ (Polanyi, 1966).From one side, we specify that tacit knowledge inhabits the\
    \ minds of people, depending on humans' interpretation and deriving from their\
    \ knowledge mind-set, that is difficult to interpret. In a nutshell, knowledge\
    \ is initially tacit in nature and it will be arduously developed over a long\
    \ period of time and through the trial-and-error process.On the other hand, we\
    \ recognize that knowledge is often undercapitalizing because \"the organization\
    \ does not know what it knows\" (O' Dell and Grayson, 1998).Because big data analytics\
    \ based on digital feedbacks coming from the market set a bridge between information,\
    \ knowledge, individuals and organizations that are commonly handled discretely\
    \ and silently in productive processes and business and marketing activities.This\
    \ relationship that has been considered as socially constructed will be helpful\
    \ to understand whether it is impossible to define knowledge universally. Hence,\
    \ knowledge discovering can only be outlined in practice, during social and digital\
    \ interactions between individuals.However, knowledge is embedded in the organizations,\
    \ and big data we markedly state knowledge discovery are coupled to the individual\
    \ mind and to contexts. Text mining is considered as the process of knowledge\
    \ discovery by adopting textual databases. It extracts valuable patterns or knowledge\
    \ from text papers (Balaid et al., 2016;Basole et al., 2013;Bookhamer and Zhang,\
    \ 2016). According to Fan and Li (2006), text data mining is the discovery of\
    \ new knowledge from \"written resources\" by using technologies. This has attributed\
    \ a high commercial value to text mining which generates a new \"wave of knowledge\
    \ discovery\" (Tan, 1999). In fact, it is the most natural process of knowledge\
    \ storage and discovery (Feldman et al., 1998).Text mining has been used in many\
    \ domains, such as health care, government, education and manufacturing. The text\
    \ mining process, includes technologies such as pattern matching, topic tracking,\
    \ summarization, categorization, clustering, association, information visualization\
    \ (Fan and Li, 2006). Pattern matching is done by analyzing the unstructured text\
    \ and identifying key phrases and relationships within text, and it does so by\
    \ looking for predefined sequences in the text. In turn, it has increased the\
    \ process of knowledge discovery by using text mining which has attracted the\
    \ interest from a variety of fields such as: computer science, business, finance\
    \ and artificial intelligence, etc. This requires more effort to gather non-trivial\
    \ information, but it also provides greater opportunities to implement a knowledge\
    \ discovery process (KDP). The process allows discerning trivial and non-trivial\
    \ text data and grasping knowledge present in a large amount of unstructured data.\
    \ In line with this, Cios et al. (2007) deemed that individuals tend to fail in\
    \ selecting valuable knowledge from text data. KDP calls for knowledge discovery\
    \ in databases (KDDs), based on individuating valid, novel knowledge in data.\
    \ In a nutshell, KDP is the means to extract and interpret interesting, non-trivial\
    \ knowledge, whereas KDD is the place where knowledge is extracted. The understanding\
    \ of this process offers several devices on how to manage and shape the interaction\
    \ between an individual and a machine.Given this, there are an increasing number\
    \ of studies on text mining recently which explore different aspects: Cecchini\
    \ et al. (2010) presented a study on financial words as a predictor of financial\
    \ events; Cao et al. (2011) investigated the benefits of an online review by using\
    \ the text mining approach; Geva and Zahavi (2014) argued that empirical evaluation\
    \ of an automated intraday stock recommendation system incorporates both market\
    \ data and textual news. And then moving from a customer-centered perspective\
    \ to an internal organizational view, Hogenboom et al. (2014) analyzed extraction\
    \ methods from text for decision support systems.What has emerged is that text\
    \ mining involves multidisciplinary studies and focuses on database technology,\
    \ Web-based collaborative writing, text analysis, machine learning, knowledge\
    \ discovery, etc. However, with the increased amount of research in this field,\
    \ it becomes more difficult to identify the existing studies and therefore suggest\
    \ new topics. For this reason, this article offers a systematic review of academic\
    \ articles focused on knowledge discovery derived from the text mining technique.\
    \ The systematic review is conducted by applying \"text mining at the term level,\
    \ in which knowledge discovery takes place on a more focused collection of words\
    \ and phrases that are extracted from and label each document\" (Feldman et al.,\
    \ 1998, p. 1).The objective is to improve awareness of the potential of this technique\
    \ so as to discover knowledge and further promote research collaboration between\
    \ knowledge management and information technology communities."

  content: "Owing to the phenomenon of globalization, especially in the business-to-consumer\
    \ (B2C) market, firms are creating social network-driven partnerships, and vast\
    \ amounts of information flow across and within firms, so that more and more businesses\
    \ are interested in using big data analytics (Reyes and Rosso, 2012;Liu et al.,\
    \ 2014;Lo et al., 2016). Therefore, scholars' main focus on technology and management\
    \ is to understand the impact of text mining on knowledge discovery to aid practitioners\
    \ to develop big data analytics projects and researchers to conduct new studies\
    \ (Liu et al., 2014).In particular, text mining involves working with unstructured\
    \ or semi-structured data sets such as email, full-text documents and HTML files.\
    \ The data are expressed in the form of text which are processed by technologies\
    \ and converted in structured data (Fan and Li, 2006). According to O' Mara-Eves\
    \ et al. (2015, p. 2) \"text mining is defined as the process of discovering knowledge\
    \ and structure rom unstructured data\" (i.e. text). Currently, texts are also\
    \ extracted from social media networks such as Twitter, blogs, Facebook, etc.,\
    \ to predict market behavior. In fact review rating and a reviewer's credibility,\
    \ together with central cues, can be used for information searches or for evaluating\
    \ alternatives (Baek et al., 2012;Chung and Tseng, 2012).Text mining techniques\
    \ are used to extract semantic characteristics from review texts. Semantic characteristics\
    \ are more influential than other characteristics in affecting how many helpfulness\
    \ vote reviews are received (Cao et al., 2011).The decision on which features\
    \ and classifications can be attributed to a piece of text is crucial because\
    \ an incorrect attribution of an input will result in a meaningless output. For\
    \ instance, \"bag-of-words\" is the most commonly used technique for feature selection\
    \ (Da Silva et al., 2014). The technique of creating a \"bag-of-words\" involved\
    \ breaking up text into words, treating each word as a feature and counting the\
    \ frequency of occurrence of the word and ignoring the co-occurrence. Feature\
    \ selection is the most often used technique among scholars, even though the major\
    \ limitation is that they have ignored the co-occurrence, order of occurrence\
    \ and association (Schumaker et al., 2012). Alongside, a noun-based feature selection\
    \ is another technique which involves j JOURNAL OF KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT j the\
    \ selection of the noun parts of the speech and then using syntactic rules to\
    \ find out noun phrases by using used the MUC-7 framework for entity classification.\
    \ Liu et al. (2012) built a named entity recognition (NER) system for identifying\
    \ tweets containing named entities using a linear conditional random field (CRF)\
    \ model. Syntactic n-grams is another technique which uses a contiguous sequence\
    \ of n items, i.e. words belonging to a given sequence of text (Butler and Kes\
    \ ˇelj, 2009;Hagenau et al., 2013). Additionally, there are a number of combination\
    \ techniques for short-text classification using lexical and semantic features,\
    \ Bayesian learner, a TF-IDF-based selector, a filterbased probabilistic approach,\
    \ a generative probabilistic model and latent Dirichl et al. location technique\
    \ (Nassirtoussi et al., 2014).Besides these is the technique of feature selection,\
    \ which is a step in the pre-processing stage of data mining, followed by dimensionality\
    \ reduction. Therefore, dimensionality reduction also becomes critical to the\
    \ process of text mining (Schumaker and Chen, 2009). Predefined dictionaries can\
    \ be used for dimensionality reduction such as general-use dictionaries like the\
    \ WordNet thesaurus, or using a term extraction tool to dynamically create a text\
    \ corpus (Nassirtoussi et al., 2014).Many studies have used text mining approaches\
    \ to study the impact of news on market behavior. Schumaker et al. (2012) applied\
    \ positive and negative sentiment analysis to subjective news articles to predict\
    \ price direction and trading return. Yu et al. (2013) proposed a contextual entropy\
    \ model to create a thesaurus of emotion words and their corresponding intensities\
    \ from online stock market news articles. An entropy measure was used to calculate\
    \ the similarity between the seed words and candidate words and then used to classify\
    \ the sentiment of the news articles. Hagenau et al. (2013) used a combination\
    \ of advanced feature extraction methods and a feedback-based feature selection\
    \ to boost classification accuracy and improve sentiment analytics. According\
    \ to them, feature selection significantly improves classification accuracies\
    \ by reducing the number of less-explanatory features, i.e. noise, and thus, may\
    \ limit negative effects of over-fitting when applying machine learning approaches\
    \ to classify text messages.This framework is confirmed primarily with Do ¨rre\
    \ et al. (1999) who acknowledged that text mining has the same functions of data\
    \ mining, primarily concerning the domain of textual information and relying on\
    \ sophisticated text analysis techniques that distinguish information from free\
    \ text documents. Then, Gupta and Lehal (2009) confirmed text mining is the discovery\
    \ of new, previously unknown information, automatically extracted from different\
    \ written and computerized resources.In addition, Tan (1999) proposed a framework\
    \ which explains the main characteristics of text data mining, referring to the\
    \ process of extracting interesting and non-trivial patterns or knowledge from\
    \ text documents. It consist of two components. The first one is related to text\
    \ refining that transforms unstructured text documents into an intermediate form.\
    \ The other is recall as knowledge distillation that deduces patterns or knowledge\
    \ from the intermediate form.Accordingly, the knowledge extraction could be interpreted\
    \ as: n vast process with heterogeneous and various data sources; n independent\
    \ with dispersed and decentralized control; and n problematic and progressing\
    \ in data and knowledge associations (Feldman et al., 1998;Mustafa et al., 2009).Furthermore,\
    \ Yoon and Park (2004) investigate text mining networks and provide a highperformance\
    \ analytical tool to analyze technology trends, given standardized and reliable\
    \ information feedback.This trend is further confirmed by Mierswa et al. (2006)\
    \ providing the Yale, a free open source for data extracting from machine learning,\
    \ able to fuse and form data from multiple sources.In general, there is a need\
    \ to carefully design models and metrics that are able to analyze model correlations\
    \ between disseminated texts and websites and are able to extract the best information\
    \ from big data (Ristoski and Paulheim, 2016).In this regard, literature also\
    \ discusses the technical challenges related to data samples, structures, heterogeneity\
    \ of sources, mining models and algorithms and systems' infrastructures that would\
    \ support data analytics (Khan et al., 2014;Nahm and Mooney, 2002;Larsen and Aone,\
    \ 1999).Differently, Li and Lai (2014) argue about the efficiency of mining in\
    \ smaller samples of data for online purchase -the micro blogosphere -which are\
    \ in contrast to mining a whole data set, specifically large data sets (e.g. big\
    \ data). They confirm the advancement in analytical applications, specifically\
    \ when text and data drawing are from large databases (for instance collecting\
    \ opinions from friends or community of practices). Information is widely interpretative\
    \ but can create significant opportunities for online sales.According to the latest\
    \ developments in this area, the mainstream in literature works on frameworks'\
    \ mapping and predicting learning curves which aim at aiding developed discretionary\
    \ manipulation proxies to study the desired data mining error bound specified\
    \ by users. Many authors concluded that it is, for the most part, unnecessary\
    \ to mine a large data set in volume. Otherwise, it is usually sufficient to sample\
    \ only up to 1 per cent of the data set for mining (Jicheng et al., 1999;Cohen\
    \ and Hersh, 2005;Gopal et al., 2011;Hu et al., 2012). In particular, Lu and Li\
    \ (2013) have developed an algorithm for bias correction in small samples drawn\
    \ from online big data portals (e.g. Twitter and Facebook). They argue that bias\
    \ mainly depends on the expected number of collisions in the sample.Contrarily,\
    \ a stream of researchers acknowledge the lacks of accurate and estimate techniques\
    \ for consumer reviews in business and marketing analysis, thus introducing an\
    \ accurate bootstrapping-based framework that estimates results and errors for\
    \ the different mining techniques (Galitsky et al., 2009;Geva and Zahavi, 2014;Hu\
    \ et al., 2014).Finally, several authors focused on the biomedical sector focusing\
    \ their research activities on reducing bias in specific samples of patients with\
    \ human disease.The evaluation of their proposed algorithms shows that they are\
    \ moderately effective for the feature of knowledge creation from free text applications\
    \ for studying and practicing the diagnosis and treatment of human disease.They\
    \ are considerably more efficient and scalable than some of the existing state-of-the-art\
    \ batch feature selection algorithms (Uramoto et al., 2004;Cohen and Hersh, 2005;Zhou\
    \ et al., 2010).More recently, however, other researchers focused on query optimization\
    \ techniques over big data in semantics, providing repeatable attribution to data\
    \ scientists when algorithms are not efficient in performing text mining on big\
    \ data. Thus, they proposed new algorithms based on review texts to understand\
    \ online users' helpfulness voting behavior for building content-based recommender\
    \ systems useful to reduce the input/output costs (Ristoski and Paulheim, 2016;Hogenboom\
    \ et al., 2014;Cao et al., 2011)."

  content: "A systematic review brings results together and shows different perspectives\
    \ to inform scholars and practitioners to address further research (O' Mara-Eves\
    \ et al., 2015, p. 3). In this line, the authors identify the main publications\
    \ from 1999 to 2017, showing how knowledge discovery has been approached by adopting\
    \ the text mining technique. The scope is to reduce the effect of publication\
    \ redundancy. Basically, the authors adopt a j JOURNAL OF KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT\
    \ j multi-layered method to searching which is based on a wide Boolean searches\
    \ of online reference databases, key information and \"citation trails\".Additionally,\
    \ the systematic review is also conducted by applying \"text mining at the term\
    \ level, in which knowledge discovery takes place on a more focused collection\
    \ of words and phrases that are extracted from and label each document\" (Feldman\
    \ et al., 1998, p. 1). This approach involves extracting labels which correspond\
    \ to keywords, which consequently represent the main topic of an article. It calls\
    \ for two approaches: manual labeling and automated technique.The manual labelling\
    \ is the most difficult but more effective. It requires an individual who has\
    \ to label each document in which it can be difficult to extract the right keywords.\
    \ Whereas, the automated technique tends to be an inaccurate and time-consuming\
    \ process. This is because it requires a person to label each document first and\
    \ then the machine can label future documents (Lent et al., 1997).In this article,\
    \ the authors used the manual labeling approach, associating each document with\
    \ a label derived from \"term extraction method\". To do so, the authors used\
    \ two main labels which, in taxonomy terms, are defined as \"knowledge discovery\"\
    \ and \"text mining\".Thus, a database of the year of publication, a topic (which\
    \ includes part of the abstract or the main information that allows the authors\
    \ to extract other terms to categorize each paper in one of the main labels, i.e.\
    \ knowledge discovery or text mining), the journal or book and the author(s),\
    \ is created. These categories are also known as entities which allow to identify\
    \ information without having to analyze the primary sources. This is in line with\
    \ statement: \"reference databases refer or point the users to another source\
    \ such as a document, an organization or an individual for additional information\
    \ or the full text of the document.\" Therefore, a first screening was made individuating\
    \ publications where the concepts of knowledge discovery and text mining were\
    \ reported. In particular, this first screening was composed of two stages. Second,\
    \ we identified top cited papers on Google Sgqcholar, analyzing how the development\
    \ and deployment of data mining frameworks and methods have also opened the doors\
    \ for academics and practitioners to knowledge discovery from text (Kayser and\
    \ Blind, 2017). What emerged was that these concepts were argued primarily from\
    \ 1998 to 2007. For this period, another screening was conducted to identify the\
    \ main topics of knowledge discovery. A table with four columns was created, referring\
    \ to the aforementioned categories (Table I).Following the first part of the analysis,\
    \ labels\\keywords were extracted from the \"topic\" category as reported in Figure\
    \ 1.To summarize, we reviewed 85 publications between 1998 and 2017 and then we\
    \ tried to categorize the results of the text reviewing process, which revealed\
    \ the papers belonged to two main clusters with both common and distinct characteristics.\
    \ Then, we processed and distributed the articles per year, performing a literature\
    \ review which sets and predicts the opportunities and challenges for the firms\
    \ in engaging in social and customer-based data analysis.j JOURNAL OF KNOWLEDGE\

    \ four papers were analyzed, in which text refining, knowledge distillation, topic\

    \ emerged. In 2002, two papers were published using the following terms: learned\

- header: "Discussion and conclusion"
  content: "To reduce redundant studies and to avoid the possibilities of missing\
    \ relevant publications, this present research offers a systematic literature\
    \ review.More importantly, the interest in data analytics increases exponentially\
    \ from 2010, especially with the increase of the interest in customer behavior,\
    \ leading to greater amount of development in the big data arena competition at\
    \ firm level. Some authors apply sentiment analysis alongside text mining to discover\
    \ knowledge (Schumaker et al., 2012;Yu et al., 2013). For instance, Hagenau et\
    \ al. (2013) combined feature extraction methods with sentiment analytics. In\
    \ turn, websites become the space where disseminated texts are present to extract\
    \ the best information from big data (Ristoski and Paulheim, 2016). Hence, texts\
    \ are analyzed in the form of data samples, structures, heterogeneity of sources,\
    \ mining models and algorithms and system infrastructures with the aim of generating\
    \ knowledge (Khan et al., 2014;Nahm and Mooney, 2002). Microblogs are another\
    \ foci of interest to evaluate user opinion and therefore create significant opportunities\
    \ for online sales (Li and Lai, 2014). Small samples drawn from online big data\
    \ portals (e.g. Twitter and Facebook) are investigated in depth to avoid bias\
    \ (Lu and Li, 2013). This evokes the interest of applying a bootstrapping-based\
    \ framework that estimates results and errors for the different mining techniques\
    \ (Geva and Zahavi, 2014;Hu et al., 2014).Aside from the period from 1998 to 2009,\
    \ digital platforms such as Twitter, blogs and Facebook, etc. were not so pervasive\
    \ and therefore less associated with the phenomena of knowledge discovery and\
    \ text mining. In fact, text mining was considered having the same functions as\
    \ data mining (Do ¨rre et al., 1999). However, Tan (1999) defined text mining\
    \ as the process of extracting interesting and non-trivial patterns by two steps:\
    \ text refining and knowledge distillation. It generates new knowledge and, as\
    \ stated by Mustafa et al. (2009), this knowledge is derived from nuances of heterogeneous\
    \ knowledge and a varied source of data (Feldman et al., 1998). This introduces\
    \ the concept of knowledge discovery more widely. According to Gupta and Lehal\
    \ (2009), text mining is the discovery of trends extracted from different written\
    \ and computerized resources. The concept of a multivariate source induces studies\
    \ on text-mining networks (Yoon and Park, 2004) and free open source for data\
    \ extracting from machine learning (Mierswa et al., 2006).In short, in the first\
    \ period (1998)(1999)(2000)(2001)(2002)(2003)(2004)(2005)(2006)(2007)(2008)(2009),\
    \ the studies on knowledge discovery by applying text mining were approached in\
    \ a more technical way. For instance, there were more studies in the engineering\
    \ and biomedical sectors. With reference to the latter, the scope was to reduce\
    \ bias in patients' disease (Uramoto et al., 2004;Cohen and Hersh, 2005). From\
    \ the second period (2010-2017), more disciplines were interested in this phenomenon.\
    \ For example, scholars from the business field were developing research to better\
    \ understand customer behavior to boost sales and reduce costs (Ristoski and Paulheim,\
    \ 2016;Hogenboom et al., 2014;Cao et al., 2011). As a result, text mining is penetrating\
    \ various sectors (e.g. medical, e-commerce, health, retail, insurance, etc.).\
    \ This penetration is supported by the overwhelming amount of data available from\
    \ different sources e.g. Web applications, trajectory data, streaming data, RFID,\
    \ etc. which are growing at an increasing rate (Chen et al., 2012). j JOURNAL\
    \ OF KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT j According to the results of the text mining analysis,\
    \ we are able to categorize paper reviews into three main branches depending on\
    \ common and distinct characteristics: technical algorithms, framework analysis\
    \ and performance platforms. This systematic review opens a new research scenario\
    \ toward contributing to theoretical and practical implications by deriving knowledge\
    \ and qualitative unstructured patterns from text data set.From a theoretical\
    \ point of view, this paper sheds light on past and recent issues, challenges\
    \ that drive new models and theories in knowledge management studies. In particular,\
    \ the emphasis on data and text mining represents a new source of complexity for\
    \ business organizations by validating the tendency of external sources of knowledge\
    \ (Vrontis et al., 2017). Nowadays, a large amount of information is available\
    \ in the form of textual data which needs to be categorized and embed in the knowledge\
    \ management system of a firm (Miao et al., 2009). From a practical point of view,\
    \ text mining techniques interpret a successful story that will guide the trajectories\
    \ for consultants, firms and clients in their future environment. Accordingly,\
    \ practitioners could benefit from research by using the right methods for their\
    \ analysis to predict markets. For instance, global economy customers have more\
    \ sophisticated needs and therefore the urgency for understanding these needs\
    \ through online text is greatly increased. The online text represents customers'\
    \ opinions, production quality documentation and technical knowledge (Kornfein\
    \ and Goldfrab, 2007). It needs to be converted in operational data to be embraced\
    \ in the KM process. In turn, it improves product and service quality and offers\
    \ solution for organizational issues, generating a new knowledge, which can be\
    \ re-used for further projects. However, knowledge workers and decision-makers\
    \ need to be supported in discovering knowledge patterns (Ur-Rahman and Harding,\
    \ 2012).In this line, we recognize there is an increasing interest on text data\
    \ analytics form both a practical and an academic point of view. In reference\
    \ to the latter, most prior research have confronted the text of social network\
    \ analytics but surprisingly there are no insights on how text mining would integrate\
    \ new communication and marketing processes. Additionally, another gap has individuated\
    \ on the topic of entrepreneurial knowledge and text mining on social data.Despite\
    \ the need for more research, we are also conscious of some limitations related\
    \ to the present research. First, this research is almost exploratory and interpretative\
    \ and reflects the interpretation of the authors about the framework to use, the\
    \ theory to understand and text documents to analyze. Therefore, we follow this\
    \ text mining-based approach to analyze literature and, in an attempt to find\
    \ hidden patterns in the content of documents, the corpus of the study has been\
    \ text-mined.Second, another limitation is the difficulty of understanding patterns\
    \ to be analyzed. While advances in data mining encompass very powerful algorithms,\
    \ there are a few advances in the literature reviewed on driving the KDP toward\
    \ appropriate results.In addition, text mining techniques are beginning to encounter\
    \ problems because of the growing volume of data requiring analysis. Finally,\
    \ we are aware that new research could be in the form of increased analytics,\
    \ applied to primary data and according to precise research patterns.Further research\
    \ therefore needs to be carried out to gather sufficient knowledge regarding this\
    \ phenomenon. In this way, future directions of research could involve other business\
    \ sectors by applying specific metrics. This research tends to aggregate different\
    \ disciplines, showing the common studies from a wide range of subjects based\
    \ on online text mining. This is, in fact, a first comprehensive systematic review\
    \ on knowledge discovery and text mining through the use of a text mining technique\
    \ at term level, which offers to reduce redundant studies and to avoid the problem\
    \ of missing relevant publications. "
