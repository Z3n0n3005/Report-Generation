abstractSeg: "The present study demonstrates a comprehensive overview about text mining\
  \ and its current research status. In our study, we collected, and textually analyzed\
  \ through various text mining techniques, three hundred refereed journal articles\
  \ in the field of mobile learning from six scientific databases, namely: Springer,\
  \ Wiley, Science Direct, SAGE, IEEE, and Cambridge."

- header: "Introduction"
  content: "A study by [2] stated that text mining has become one of the trendy fields\
    \ that has been incorporated in several research fields such as computational\
    \ linguistics, Information Retrieval (IR) and data mining. The outcomes can be\
    \ stored in a management information system that provides a large amount of significant\
    \ information for the user of that system.Text mining intends to detect the information\
    \ that was not recognized before through extracting it automatically from various\
    \ text-based sources."
- header: "Related Work"
  content: "The primary focus of these researches was to determine how different text\
    \ mining procedures can be utilized as the structured data sets exist in the text\
    \ document format. It offers the opportunity to show an arrangement of sub-topics\
    \ in huge sets of documents in compact graph form.In order to offer a reference\
    \ for additional researches of other researchers, [37] discussed the research\
    \ status of text mining technology when it was used in the biomedical field that\
    \ covers 10 years."
- header: "Experimental Results"
  content: "These articles are categorized into six folders, where each folder represents\
    \ the database where these articles were retrieved.The presence of the linguistic\
    \ noise is a common problem in the content of the extracted articles and we have\
    \ dealt with. The minimum number of the characters that the token should have\
    \ is 4, while the maximum number is 25 characters.The application of various text\
    \ mining techniques on the collected articles presents different results and suggestions."
- header: "Conclusion"
  content: "This creates a need for collecting a dataset that consists of several\
    \ research articles in the field of mobile learning from different scientific\
    \ databases, and applying the proposed approach on them.Three hundred refereed\
    \ journal articles from six scientific databases were collected, and textually\
    \ analyzed through text mining techniques. The selection of the collected articles\
    \ was based on the criteria that all these articles should incorporate mobile\
    \ learning as the main component in the higher educational context."
